<p>While to scenery, it is distance,—and photography,—which
lends enchantment, it is, on the contrary, propinquity which, in
my experience, lends to the Borneo Head-Hunters and to their
Home-life, a charm which cannot be wholly dispelled even by the
skulls hanging from the rafters of their houses. After living
among them, for months at a time, an insight is gained into their
individualities and peculiarities which a casual sojourn can never
disclose. Some, of course, are ill-tempered, crotchety, selfish;
others, again, are mild, gentle, generous. The youths have their
languishing loves, which they are eager to confide to sympathetic
ears. The maidens are coy, or demure, or bashful, when their
lovers are near, and delight in teasing and tormenting. The
Bornean mothers and fathers think their babies the prettiest that
ever were born; and the young boys are as boyish as school-boys
here at home, and are quite as up to all mischief.</p>

<p>It is so much easier to descend than it is to rise in what we
call civilization, that, before a month is passed in a Kayan or a
Kenyah house, the host and hostess, who, on first sight, seemed
to be uncouth savages, frightfully mutilated as to eyes, ears, and
teeth, are regarded as kind-hearted, devoted friends. It becomes
well-nigh impossible to realise that they cannot add the simplest
of sums without the aid of fingers and toes; and that Cæsar,
Shakespeare, and Washington are to them meaningless, unpronounceable
words.</p>

<p>Their honesty, (in a twelve months’ residence the only thing
stolen from me was a tooth-powder bottle,) their simple, child-like
nature, their keen interest in the pursuit of the moment, and
their vivacious excitability, place them in advance of any ‘savages’
with whom I have ever, in my many wanderings, come in
contact.</p>

<p>The greater part of my time in Borneo was spent among the
Kayans and Kenyahs of the Baram district of Sarawak; consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
in the following pages I have barely mentioned the
Dayaks, (or Ibans, as they call themselves,) or any of the coast
tribes, of whose home-life I saw comparatively little; so much
has been already written about these tribes that I am jealous for
my friends of the far interior.</p>

<p>I have refrained from giving dates, or details, as to the height
of the thermometer, or as to my personal comfort or health, or
as to the number of men who carried my luggage, or what I had
for breakfast, or dinner,—items extremely important at the time,
but of no permanent or public interest whatsoever.</p>

<p>I have attempted to portray the impressions made on a mind
which I endeavoured to keep wholly unprejudiced, and even free
from all tendency to despise as gross superstition that which by
the natives is deemed holy and religious. I do not wish to forget
that I was received as an honoured guest in Kayan Long-houses;
it is a sorry payment to vilify my hosts. Rather let me
throw what charm I may over the daily round of the natives’
dateless life.</p>

<p>To His Highness Rajah <span class="smcap">Brooke</span>, I owe sincere thanks, not
alone for his kind hospitality, but for facilities in freely visiting
all parts of his admirably governed territory, and for his liberal
permission to collect Ethnological and Natural History material.</p>

<p>It is with pleasure that I acknowledge my indebtedness to
the Rajah’s Resident, Dr. <span class="smcap">Charles Hose</span>, for valuable information
on innumerable points, for a genial hospitality of many
weeks, and for the opportunities to visit the people of his
District, ‘my people,’ as he likes to call them, whose manners
and customs he knows so thoroughly, and whose interests he
guards with so much vigilance and efficiency.</p>

<p>The houses in which the Borneo people live are the outcome
of a life of constant apprehension of attacks from head-hunters.
In union alone is strength. Surrounded by a dense jungle which
affords, night and day, up to the very steps to their homes, a
protecting cover for enemies, the Borneans live, as it were, in
fighting trim, with their backs to a hollow square. A village of
scattered houses would mean the utmost danger to those on the
outskirts; consequently, houses which would ordinarily form a
village have been crowded together until one roof covers them
all. The rivers and streams are the only thoroughfares in the
island, and village houses are always built close to the river-banks,
so that boats can be quickly reached; this entails another
necessity in the construction of the houses. The torrents during
the rainy season, which, on the western half of the island, lasts
from October till February, swell the rivers with such suddenness
and to such an extent that in a single night the water will overflow
banks thirty feet high, and convert the jungle round about
into a soggy swamp; unless the houses were built of stone they
would be inevitably swept away by the rush of water; wherefore
the natives build on high piles and live above the moisture
and decay of the steaming ground.</p>

<p>Beneath the houses is the storage-place for canoes that are
leaky and old, or only half finished and in process of being
sprung and spread out into proper shape before being fitted up
with gunwales and thwarts. It is generally a very disorderly
and noisome place, where all the refuse from the house is thrown,
and where pigs wallow, and chickens scratch for grains of rice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
that fall from the husking mortars in the veranda overhead.
Between the houses and the river’s bank,—a distance of a hundred
yards, more or less,—the jungle is cleared away, and in its
place are clumps of cocoanut, or Areca palms, and, here and there,
small storehouses, built on piles, for rice. In front of the houses
of the Kayans there are sure to be one or two forges, where the
village blacksmiths, makers of spear-heads, swords, hoes, and axes,
hold an honorable position. In the shade of the palms the boat-builders’
sheds protect from the scorching heat of the sun the
great logs that are being scooped out to form canoes; the ground
is covered with chips, from which arises a sour, sappy odor that
is almost pungent and is suggestive of all varieties of fever, but
is really quite harmless. In the open spaces tall reedy grass
grows, and after hard rains a misstep, from the logs forming a
pathway, means to sink into black, oozy mud up to the knees.</p>

<p>Just on the bank of the river there are usually four or five
posts, about eight feet high, roughly carved at the top to represent
a man’s head; these have been put up after successful head-hunting
raids, and on them are tied various fragments of the
enemy,—a rib, or an arm, or a leg bone; these offerings drive
away the evil Spirits who might wish to harass the inmates of
the house, and they also serve as a warning to enemies who
may be planning an attack. Such remnants of the enemy are
held by no means in the same veneration with which the heads,
hung up in the house, are regarded; after the bits of flesh and
bone are tied to the posts they are left to the wind and rain, the
pigs and chickens.</p>

</figure>

<p>Not a few of the Kayan and Kenyah houses have been
enlarged and built out at both ends until they shelter from six
hundred to a thousand persons, and are possibly a quarter of a
mile long; this statement seems to verge on a ‘traveller’s tale,’
but it must be remembered that these houses are really villages
of a single street, the veranda being a public thoroughfare, unobstructed
throughout its whole length, in front of the private
family rooms. From the ground to the veranda a notched log
serves as steps, and it takes no little practice to enable a
clumsy, leather-shod foreigner to make a dignified entrance into
a Borneo house. The notches in the log are worn very smooth
by the constant tread of bare feet, and, as there is no door-mat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
below for muddy feet, the shallow notches are often coated with
a thin and treacherous layer of slime; foreigners generally enter
a Kayan house on all fours, giving to the natives an astounding
idea of occidental manners. To the natives, however, these steps
present no difficulties,—no matter how steep or slimy the log,
they seem to get a firm hold on the edge of the notches with
their prehensile toes, and, even with heavy loads on their backs,
walk up as freely as if on level ground. The piles on which the
large houses rest are fifteen or twenty feet high, and often two
and a half feet in diameter at the base; in some few cases they
are carved with grotesque figures of human heads, or conventionalised
representations of monkeys, crocodiles, and snakes.</p>

<p>In the days before the humanising influence of Rajah Brooke’s
government had spread to the Kayans, and Kenyahs, and tribes
living in the central highlands, it was a preliminary custom, in
building a house, to thrust into the first excavation wherein the
heavy, up-river, corner post was to rest, a young slave girl alive,
and the mighty post was then planted on her body, crushing out
her life as a propitiatory offering to the demons that they should
not molest the dwelling. Happily, this custom has been abolished,
and in houses now built, instead of a girl, a pig or a fowl has
been substituted. I regret to add that in the house of Tama
Bulan, wherein we lived for some time, the earlier custom had
been followed.</p>

<p>The roofs of the houses are partly thatched and partly
shingled. The shingles are hewn out of ‘Billian,’ a species of
iron-wood which stands for years, without decay, the alternate
change from damp to dry heat; each one has a square hole at
its upper end, through which passes the strip of rattan wherewith
it is tied to the frame of the roof. The thatching is of
palm leaves doubled over a stick five feet long and then bound
on the roof, overlapping like shingles; several layers of these
palm-leaf tiles make a perfectly tight roof, and one that may
be quickly repaired. In building a Borneo house not a nail is
used and but very few pegs; all beams and cross-ties are either
roughly mortised and bound together, or else merely tied one on
top of the other with rattan or with long strips of fibrous bark;
even the planks of the floor or walls are not pegged, but are tied
to one another and laced to the joists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>In selecting the site for a house, before so much as a twig of
the jungle is cleared away, there are always extreme and prolonged
pains taken to discover, through ‘Omen birds,’ the temper
of the evil Spirits of that locality,—to a Kayan there are no such
things as beneficent Spirits. Until this temper is definitely discovered
the whole household is under a ‘permantong,’ or
taboo, and may not leave its quarters, whatever these quarters
may be, be they the old house or a temporary shelter.</p>

<p>This taboo lasts many days,—ten days perhaps,—during which
certain old men who know the habits of omen birds and omen
animals make frequent trips into the surrounding jungle to observe
whether the red hawk fly, or whether the little honey-sucker
bird, (called the ‘Isit,’) chirp to them, on the right or on the left of
their path. Finally, they must catch a glimpse of the barking
deer, and then the welfare of the house is assured. As soon as
one of these favorable omens is seen the hunters build a fire,—a
signal to the birds and animals, conveying thanks for favors
received. When the last of these omens has been seen, then,
and not until then, is the permantong over and the clearing for
the house begun, and all hands turn in to help.</p>

<p>The veranda, or main street, of these houses is where all
public life goes on; here, in the smoky atmosphere that pervades
the place, councils of war and peace are held, feasts spread, and a
large part of the daily work performed. It is seldom a very
bright or cheery place; the eaves come down so low that the
sunlight penetrates only at sunrise and sunset, and the sooty
smoke from the fires turns all the woodwork to a sombre,
mahogany hue. The floor is usually of broad, hewn planks,
loosely laid upon the joists, with little care whether they fit close
or warp and bend up out of shape, leaving wide cracks through
which a small child might fall; they show plainly the cuts of the
adze, but they soon become polished by the leathery soles of
bare feet shuffling over them from dawn till dark. At intervals
of perhaps fifty feet are fireplaces,—merely shallow boxes about
five feet square by six inches deep, filled with flat stones imbedded
in clay; herein are built the fires that give light at night and add
to sociability at all times; no council or friendly talk is complete
without the crackle of a fire to enliven it and to keep away
evil Spirits. Of course, no chimney carries off the smoke, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
must disperse as best it can among the cob-webby beams overhead,
after giving a fresh coat of soot to the row or bunch of
trophy-skulls that hangs in the place of honor opposite to the
door of the chief’s room. The odor of burning resinous wood,
mingled with other ingredients, saturates the veranda, and in after-life
the smell of musty garret, cedar-wood chests, and brush-wood
burning in the autumn instantly recalls the veranda of a Borneo
long-house. It must be confessed that occasionally there mingles
with this aromatic odor a tang of wet dog, wallowing pig, and
ancient fish, but then, after all, these are not peculiar to Borneo.</p>

</figure>

<p>There is no ceiling to a Borneo long-house; above the plank
walls that divide the private rooms from the veranda, and from
one another, the space is open to the ridge-pole. Across the
rafters are placed, higgledy-piggledy, spare boards, supplies of
dried rattan, and long rolls of bamboo matting; here and there,
hang rice baskets, hampers, wicker fish-traps of all sizes; and
sometimes every available space is hung with bunches of bananas,
which must be gathered green and ripened in the house, to keep
them from the depredations of monkeys and fruit-bats. At intervals
along the roof are trap-doors of palm-leaf thatch, which can
be lifted and supported on a pole to admit more light and air.
[For the accompanying photograph as many of these trap-doors
as possible had been raised in order to get enough light, and just
over the row of skulls several shingles had been taken off. In
the photograph this row of forty or fifty skulls hanging from a
beam begins with one that looks like a gourd, on the left.]</p>

<p>Along the whole length of the veranda at its outer edge,
under the eaves, is a railing, or fence, of poles and boards tied to
the upright supports of the roof; when parents in the household
are unusually careful of their children, this fence extends from
the floor to the eaves, which are here only about four feet above
the floor, but usually this safeguard is only two poles about six
inches apart, and serves as a rest for the backs of men when they
sit on the wide platforms, which are raised about a foot above the
floor and extend nearly all along this lightest and airiest part of
the house. These platforms are of much smoother planks than
the floor, and are often of single huge slabs of wood from the
buttress-like roots of the ‘Tapang’ tree. To make these lounging-places
still more luxurious, mats of fine rattan or bamboo strips<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
are spread upon them, and then a Bornean desires no more comfortable
place whereon to sit by day or to recline by night, unless,
perchance, it be a dry sandy river-bank, above the rapids, where
are no crocodiles, mosquitoes, nor pestiferous black-flies, and
where grow gigantic Caladiums, whereof a single leaf is large
enough to cover his entire body and afford him a protection
from the rain, as impervious as a rubber blanket. These low
platforms, especially in front of the chief’s door, [which in the
photograph is directly opposite the row of skulls just mentioned,]
are the places where men congregate after nightfall to gossip
and smoke round the fire, which is here needed to dispel darkness,
dampness, and evil Spirits. Diversion is often created by
one of their number, who, more self-sacrificing than the rest,
goes through the violent antics of a war-dance, or sings long,
rambling songs about the valorous deeds of Tokong, who
originated head-hunting, or of some other warrior who gained
the blissful regions of ‘Apo Legan’ by the slaughter of his
enemies. Whatever the theme,—and the themes are generally
legends or familiar stories,—the details are supplied by the imagination
of the singer, who composes them on the spur of the
moment, while the chorus is singing the last two or three words
of the verse, followed by ‘Ara Wi Wi, Ará!’ a meaningless
refrain, like our own ‘Tooral, looral,’ although I am afraid that
in a former publication I unwittingly gave the impression that
its translation was ‘Sleep dear little one, sleep.’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>To these songs an accompaniment is often played upon an
instrument, known among certain Kayans and Kenyahs as a
<i>Kaluri</i> or <i>Kaleeri</i> or <i>Kaludi</i>. It is probably of Chinese origin;
substantially the same instrument is used in China and in the
countries bordering thereon to the northward and westward. I
saw almost an exact counterpart of the Borneo Kaluri played
by the Naga tribes inhabiting the hills near the Burmese border.
It consists of a bottle-shaped gourd with six hollow reed pipes
set into the body of it; a finger-hole is cut in each pipe at such
a place that the fingers of both hands while holding the instrument
can cover all the holes. The middle reed is the longest,
and is therefore the bass; it has no finger-hole, but its tone is
subdued by a movable cap at the end; the neck of the gourd forms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
the mouth-piece. The music of a Kaluri somewhat resembles
that of organ pipes, perhaps slightly nasal in timbre, but having
an impressive charm withal when heard amid native surroundings,
in the dim, smoky atmosphere of a Borneo long-house at
night, when light from the flickering fire accentuates the harsh
lines in the faces of the natives grouped about the performer, and
where eyes, robbed of the softening effect of lashes and eyebrows,
glitter fiercely, and where brass studs glisten in pointed and
blackened teeth, and where carnivorous ferocity and alertness
is imparted to the men’s faces by the upturned tiger-cat’s teeth
in their ears,—all these so intensify the relentless, recurring,
savagely persistent minor key of the Kaluri that dim questionings
are stirred whether or not, after all, bloodshed be not the
noblest aim in life and the blackened and battered skulls overhead
be not glory’s highest prize. Music hath charms to soothe,—Kaluri
music hath charms to <i>make</i>,—a savage breast.</p>

</figure>

<p>In the verandas of the Kayan houses there are always large
wooden mortars wherein rice is hulled; from morning until
night there is always to be heard, somewhere in the length of the
house, the rhythmical thumping that betokens that young girls
are at their everlasting task of threshing, hulling, and winnowing
the rice for the daily repast. The rice mortars are cut from
large logs of wood, and are somewhat prismatic in shape, usually
five or six feet in length by two or three feet wide on the upper
surface; they rest upon a base not more than a foot wide, [as in
the photograph, where, on the right, some boys are sitting on the
edge of a mortar,] but are made firm by stout poles that are set
into them and extend through the flooring to the ground below,
and also by strong braces that are pegged to the house beams
above. The upper, broad surface of these mortars is slightly
concave, and is divided into two or more sections, each with a
round pit six inches deep in the centre. In husking the rice,
these pits are filled with the grains, and then two, or sometimes
four, girls, standing upon the broad top, pound the rice in the pit
with wooden pestles five or six feet long, which they hold at the
middle with both hands. The motion that they adopt is exceedingly
graceful; they stand with the heels together, and lift the
pole or pestle perpendicularly above their heads as high as they
can reach, then, bending the body at the hips and swinging the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
arms down, they jam the pestle into the rice pit; as they raise
the pestle again for another stroke they put one foot forward to
push back into the pit the grains that may have jumped out on
the flat surface of the mortar. When thus pounding, the young
girls keep perfect time with one another, the poles never clash,
and each girl brushes back, first with one foot, then with the
other, the grains she jostles out, so that when they pound fast
the motion becomes almost a dance. Not infrequently the pestles
are ornamented at their upper end with several sliding rings or a
sliding block that jingles when the pestle strikes; this rhythm
and this jingle impart some alleviation to the tedious task.
When the husks are all beaten off, the chaff is winnowed out by
tossing the grains and catching them again and again upon a
flat basket. The task of hulling rice falls exclusively to the
women and girls; they begin it when they are so small that they
can barely lift the pestle, and, once started in proficiency, the task
becomes an element of their life, and their winnowing-baskets are
hung as symbols of industry on their graves.</p>

<p>In the accompanying photograph of a veranda, the coffin-shaped
box hanging on the wall on the right is a case wherein
war-coats are kept, so that the goat-skin and feathers whereof
they are made cannot be eaten by hungry dogs. The photograph
does not give an absolutely correct idea of the daily
appearance of a veranda; there is only one dog to be seen,—there
should be at least a dozen. The exposure had to last so
long that, lest the dogs should jar the camera, we had them all
driven down the notched log to the ground, and then the log
was turned wrong side up, so that they could not return. (We
tried this method of getting rid of the dogs once at night
when they were particularly troublesome and quarrelsome, and
seemed to prefer our bodies to any other couch, but the crafty
curs knew an adequate revenge; as soon as they found themselves
locked out they made night hideous with concerted and
disconcerting baying at the moon, until we were glad to readmit
them. Our leather shoes we always had to tie high up on the
rafters at night, or they would have been eaten up, all but the
soles and heels.)</p>

<p>This photograph was taken from a point just opposite the
chief’s door, about half way down the length of the veranda.</p>

<p>The family rooms, even those of the chief, are often dark and
disordered little compartments, and in them it is usual for anything
but quiet to reign; the smallest of the infants sprawl on
the floor, the fowls, that have flown up to steal the rice drying on
the platforms at the back of the house, squawk and cackle, and
the old women who are relegated to culinary sinecures, such as
rice-boiling, add a mild confusion by whacking the dogs that
wander in and prowl about the cooking-pots. The space under
the eaves, unlike that of the veranda, is boarded up from floor to
roof with rough hewn planks; the only light is admitted through
small windows in the planks or through trap-doors in the roof.
Of course, there is never a pane of glass in the windows, and I
doubt that the natives of the interior, or even of the coast towns,
ever saw a glazed window.</p>

<p>In spite of the darkness of these rooms, there is, nevertheless,
more industry in them than is ever found in the veranda; the
women are really the workers of the community, and seem never
to sit absolutely idle gossiping, as do the men; when the harvesting
is finished and there is no more work out of doors, they employ
their time in making mats and baskets of rattan strips, in
stringing beads into ornaments for war-coats, in weaving cloth for
feast-day garments, and in fashioning large, round, flat hats for
the next season’s work in the rice-fields. During the rainy
season, the husbands and lovers seem to have little to do but sit
in the veranda, lounging against the railing at the open space
under the eaves, whence they can observe the river and its incidents,
and watch the smoke from their long cigarettes curl
and drift among the fronds of tall cocoanut palms that sway
and rustle on a level with their faces. These are the days when
war expeditions are planned and resolutions made to add fresh
heads to the row already hanging in front of the chief’s door, and
thereby remove any taboo enforced by the death of relatives.
The men seldom linger in the family rooms during the day, and
the women, except when busy hulling the rice in the big wooden
mortars, spend no time in the veranda.</p>

<p>The doorway from the veranda into the family room opens
into a very dark and narrow passage, with the partition wall of
the next room on one side and a rack for fire-wood and long
bamboo water-bottles on the other. Possibly it is to announce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the coming of a guest that the flooring of these little entries is
always laid down in such a wobbly fashion, and of logs and billets
of wood so rickety, that it is impossible to walk upon it without
stumbling or an unseemly clatter; whatever be the reason, such
is the fact, and I never stepped over the high threshold into the
dark of one of these passages without expecting to trample on
babies or to fall through on the wallowing pigs below.</p>

<p>The end of the passage opens directly into the middle of the
room, where the floor is better laid and made more comfortable
by the addition of mats. The whole room is perhaps twenty-five
feet square, but this space is diminished by two or three little
sleeping-closets for the parents or for the grown daughters. In
the right-hand corner, near an opening under the eaves, the floor
is raised a few inches, where the sons or the male slaves sleep at
night, and where the women work at their bead-stringing or mat-making
during the day; it is the lightest and pleasantest place
in the room. Against the partition that divides the veranda from
the room is the fireplace, which is merely a hearth of clay and
large flat stones, as in the veranda, except that in the centre are
three stones whereon the cooking pots rest; above is a rack,
just beyond the reach of the flames, where firewood is kept dry,
ready for immediate use, and where scraps of pork may be preserved
by the smoke. Here and there, on the walls, on hooks
made of deer horn or of the twisted branch of a tree, hang all
sorts of implements for farming, fishing, and hunting, little hoes
for weeding the rice-fields, home-made axes called ‘biliong,’
scoop-nets for catching fish when the streams are poisoned with
Tuba root, paddles, spears, large round sun-hats, basket-like
holders for the few but valuable china plates used only on feast-days,
and sometimes, as a mural decoration, the warrior’s coat
and shield are displayed; these personal adornments, however,
are usually kept in the little sleeping-closets, or else in a wooden
case attached to the wall of the veranda just outside the room.</p>

</figure>

<p>These sleeping-closets, partitioned off for married couples or
for unmarried girls and widows to sleep in, are as dark and
stuffy as closely fitting planks can make them, and the bed is
merely two or three broad and smooth planks whereon a fine
rattan matting is spread; sometimes a roll of matting or a bundle
of old cloth serves as a pillow, but more often there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
but the flat boards. On one occasion, I was ushered into the bedroom
of a Chief’s daughter who was ill with the grippe and had
asked for medicine; it was almost pathetic to note the attempt
that this poor ‘first lady’ had made to adorn her little boudoir.
By the light of a sputtering lump of damar gum, burning in an
earthen dish and disseminating mainly an aromatic smell and
dense smoke, and only incidentally a flickering light, I could see
that there had been fastened on the walls bright pieces of gay-colored
cloth, and over in one corner, in a sort of pyramid, were
her ‘ladyship’s’ best bead-work baskets; even ill as she was she
called my attention to them. She was tossing in fever on the
most uncomfortable bundles of coarse cotton calico, (sadly in
need of washing,) which she had crumpled in folds to counteract
the unevennesses of her bed of planks. Grippe is intolerable
enough when the patient is surrounded with every comfort, on a
soft clean bed and in an airy room, but the lowest depth of discomfort
is reached when to the fever are added a sweltering tropical
heat in a dark closet, the air dense with damar smoke and
soot, a bed of hard boards, and never a drop of ice-water. Yet
in the midst of all these, the girl, fortunate in her ignorance, was
dignified and uncomplaining.</p>

<p>On all ordinary occasions, the family eat together, usually
only twice a day, morning and evening, in the family room. In
the centre of the room is placed a large wooden dish piled
high with boiled rice, and then, as a plate for each member of
the family, is set a piece of fresh banana leaf, whereon are a little
salt and a small quantity of powdered dried fish, highly odorous;
this is the usual bill of fare, but it may be supplemented with a
sort of mush or stew of fern-frond sprouts and rice, or with boiled
Caladium roots and roasted wild yams. When there is a feast
and guests from neighboring houses come to dine, the meals are
spread in the veranda and the menu is enlarged with pork and
chicken, cooked in joints of bamboo, which have been stoppered
at both ends with green leaves, and put in the fire until they are
burnt through, when the cooking is done to a turn.</p>

<p>All hands are plunged into the common dish of plain boiled rice,
and it is ‘excellent form’ to cram and jam the mouth as full as it
will hold. It is, however, remarkable how deftly even little children
can so manipulate the boiled rice before conveying it to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
mouths, that hardly a grain is spilt; it always filled me with shame
when dining <i>en famille</i> with the Kayans or Kenyahs to note what
a mess of scattered rice I left on the mat at my place, while their
places were clean as when they sat down; to be sure, I did not
follow my hosts’ example in carefully gathering up and devouring
all that had fallen on the unswept floor. Whenever I apologized
for my clumsiness, their courtesy was always perfect; the fault
was never attributed to me, but rather to their poor food and the
manner in which it was served.</p>

<p>The long intervals between their meals and the unsubstantial
quality of their food give them such an appetite and force them
to eat so voraciously that the usual welcome by a Kayan host
to his guests is, ‘Eat slowly,’ and this admonition is unfailingly
given. They seem to regard their family meals as strictly private,
and would always announce to us that they were going to eat,—possibly
to give us warning not to visit them at that time, and
they were also quite as punctilious to leave us the moment that
our food was served.</p>

<p>When any member of a family is ill and calls in the services
of an exorciser, or, as they call it, a ‘Dayong,’ the room is placed
under a taboo, or permantong, and only members of the family
may enter, and even they are under certain restrictions, for
instance, to refrain from singing or playing musical instruments,
and they are debarred from eating meat. The sign of a taboo is
a bunch of green leaves or a flat basket used in winnowing rice
tied to the door-post. If, by accident, a man should violate this
taboo, he must pay a fine to the owners of the tabooed room;
this fine is usually a few cheap beads or a china plate. They seem
to regard this custom with such reverence that we availed ourselves
of its privileges whenever we wished for privacy, and
although the natives laughed at our adoption of their customs,
they left us nevertheless strictly alone when we tied a basket or
a bunch of leaves in front of our little apartment in the veranda.</p>

<p>Possibly, this description of Home-Life in a Borneo household
would be incomplete without a detailed account of its ordinary
daily routine, which, as I saw it during several weeks in Tama
Bulan’s house, is somewhat as follows:—<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>The crow of a cock breaks the silence of the night; then a
dog rouses up, yawns and stretches, and shakes off the ashes
of the fireplace where it has been sleeping, and begins the daily
round of quarrels with its companions. Then daylight gradually
creeps in and a door slams with a bang at the far end of
the house, where the poorer and hard-working people live; a
woman with a bundle of bamboo water-vessels slung on her
back hurries along to the stairway down to the river. She
looks just the same as when she went to sleep. Her dress is
the same and her hair is in a disordered tangle, and as she walks
her feet come down heavily on the warped planks and make
them rattle, no doubt to wake the lazy men, who sleep on and
let the women make the fire and get the water while they
snooze. Soon she comes back, her hair dripping and glossy,
and little drops of water still clinging to her skin. By this time
there is quite a procession of women going down to bathe and
get the cooking water from the river, and there is a slamming of
doors and a few wails from the children. Then the men who
have been sleeping on the raised platform along the open space
below the eaves, unroll themselves from their shroud-like coverings
of cotton cloth, once white, and a little hum of conversation
springs up, possibly a comparison of dreams, the interpretation
of which, as in all uneducated classes, has a great bearing on
their daily life. The mother who comes out with her babies in
her arms, or sitting astride of her hips, knows nothing of our
custom of caressing with a kiss, but in her maternal bursts of
affection she buries her face in the neck of the child and draws
in a long breath through her nostrils; in fact, she smells it. In
their language the verbs <i>to smell</i> and <i>to kiss</i> are the same. Then
down she goes to the river and takes the morning bath with her
child in her arms, sometimes holding it by the hands and letting
it kick out its legs like a frog,—the first lessons in swimming.
One by one the men straggle off to bathe in the river, and never
missed the opportunity of telling us that they were going to bathe,
and when they returned they were also most punctilious in telling
us that they <i>had</i> bathed. With all this bathing, however,
they are not a clean people. Soap is unknown to them, and they
never use hot water, consequently their skins have not the soft,
velvety appearance that constant bathing usually produces. (We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
once gave some of the girls cakes of Pears’ soap, but they ate
them.)</p>

<p>After bathing there is a lull in the activity of the house, while
the married women and young girls cook the morning meal of
boiled rice and dried salted fish.</p>

<p>Breakfast over there are always parties of men and women
setting out for the clearings where the rice is planted, and
armed with a billiong (an adze-like axe, which they use) and
their parang, and their spear, the men go down and get the boats
ready, and the women follow after with the paddles, and hampers
to bring back bananas or bunches of tender, young fern-fronds,
which they make into a stew. Then the house settles down to
the ordinary tasks of making large flat hats of palm leaves, drying
and flattening banana leaves for cigarette wrappers, or of
pounding the husks off the rice by the women, and sharpening
spears or decorating parangs by the men industriously inclined;
but the latter are rare. They usually spend their time in gossip
with their companions or merely sit and blink, soothed by long
draughts of smoke drawn deep into their lungs from the strong
Java tobacco cigarettes, which they roll for themselves. Men,
women, and children all smoke.</p>

<p>Morning wears into afternoon, and then the hours are given
up to recreation by those who had not gone in the forenoon to
the rice-fields. Occasionally, we sat on the river-bank and
watched from a high bluff the young boys or the young girls
playing in the water. Here let me say that we never saw the
faintest conscious immodesty in either the one or the other. We
used to sit lost in admiration at the skill of the girls in swimming.
It was a sort of game of tag that they were always playing,
only, instead of one chasing all, all chased one, and this one
would get off some little distance from the rest and then suddenly
disappear under water. Then the chase begins. All swim
as fast as they can to the spot where she had vanished, some
swimming with a rapid overhand stroke, while others swam
entirely under the water. Then, possibly still in front of them,
possibly far behind, up bobbed the girl who was ‘<i>it</i>,’ shaking
the water from her eyes and giving a shout of derision at her
pursuers. Down she went again and the chase was renewed,
all under water, so long, sometimes, that the surface of the river<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
became perfectly smooth, and no one would have imagined that
in another moment it would be again bubbling up and dashed
into spray by a crowd of laughing, shouting, black-haired, merry
girls. Back and forth, up and down, they splashed from one side
of the river to the other, until one of the men called to them from
the house to stop their sport lest they rouse a sleeping crocodile.
This put an end to the fun. Another thing, which was quite new
to us, was the way in which they could play a sort of tune by
splashing their hands in the water and flapping their arms to
their sides. They stood in a group, and by sinking their hands,
the back downward, in the water and then clapping them above the
water and slapping their elbows to their sides, they produced a
series of different sounds, like that of a large stone dropping into
a deep pool, with a rhythm that was perfect and very pleasing.</p>

<p>Afternoon deepens into dusk, and the workers from the
fields come home and trudge wearily up the bank and disappear
through the little doorways. Small flickering lamps are
lit here and there, and the fire on the hearth disseminates a
cheery glow and warms up the row of human skulls hanging
in front of the Chief’s door. The veranda gradually becomes
deserted, even by the dogs, while the families are eating their
evening meals in their private rooms. The noisy flapping of
wings and cackling of chickens seeking their roosts for the night
and the low, contented grunts of pigs beneath the house betoken
that the day’s foraging is over.</p>

<p>After the evening meal the men once more lounge out in the
veranda and, grouped about the low, smouldering fires, smoke
their long cigarettes and gossip, or listen to the drone of the
Kaluri played by one of the youths. By eight or nine o’clock
they are all once more wrapped in their coverings of cotton
cloth, and, stretched in a row beneath the eaves, lulled by ‘lisp
of leaves or ripple of rain.’</p>

</div>

<p>One day, during my second visit to Borneo, I was sitting in
the veranda of a native’s house on the Tinjar River, chatting and
gossiping with my host and his household, when I noticed in the
group a man whose face was very familiar to me and closely
associated with some incident or other in the year before; I
looked at him for a minute, and then asked if he were not the
man who had so effectively helped us when we were unable to
find men to paddle our canoe down the river from the house of
deceitful old Laki La. He modestly replied that he was one
of the men; whereupon I reiterated my gratitude to him; but,
unfortunately, his name, once so familiar to me, had quite escaped
my memory, and, apologizing for my forgetfulness, I asked him
what it was. His countenance fell; he looked much embarrassed
for a moment, and then nudging the man sitting next to him
looked from him to me. His neighbor took the hint, and at
once told me the name, which was one I had never before heard;
I concluded, therefore, that either he or I had mistaken the incident.
A little while afterward I happened to meet the man again
when he was alone, and being so sure in my recollection of his
face, asked him if that were really his name which had been told
to me; he assured me that it was, but even then I doubted, and
insisted that it was not the name by which I had known him a
year ago. ‘You are quite right, Tuan,’ he replied, ‘but since
you were here I have been exceedingly sick—so sick that the
evil Spirits were trying to make my soul wander away from my
body [and here his voice dropped to a whisper]; so I changed
my name; now they will not know where to find me.’ He
looked furtively on all sides, as if afraid that the trick would be
overheard by the Spirits; it was only after much persuasion and
repeated assurances that the Spirits could never harm him through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
a white man that I induced him to tell me his former name, which
he did in a timid whisper close to my ear. This incident, trifling
in itself, is valuable, I think, in that it adds another to the list of
instances recorded in Dr. J. G. Frazer’s valuable <i>The Golden Bough</i>
(vol. i., pp. 404-420), where the utterance of a personal name is
fraught with an unknown and deadly peril. To speculate on the
source of this mysterious dread is tempting enough,—especially
since in theorizing about the beliefs prevalent in the youth of the
world there is no one who can contradict. As to its antiquity
there can be no doubt; and that it is well nigh universal, the
records of folk-lore are full of proof. It is sufficient here and
now to note its existence among the Kayans and Kenyahs in the
interior of Borneo, where, moreover, this unwillingness to utter
the name of a person extends to inanimate objects. When they
have planned a Tuba fishing, nothing will induce them to utter
the word for fish. A Kayan, Kenyah, or Punan never thinks of
saying that he is going to search for camphor, but that he is
going to look for the ‘thing that smells,’ and even this he says
in a whisper, for fear the camphor crystals deep in their secret,
native home might hear and elude him after he had all the
trouble of chopping down the tree.</p>

<p class="caption2">HE IS OF THE KENYAH TRIBE, AND LIVES ON THE PATA RIVER, ABOUT

‘FATHER OF MOON,’ AND WAS ASSUMED AFTER THE BIRTH OF HIS FIRST
CHILD, A DAUGHTER, NAMED ‘BULAN.’ HIS PREVIOUS NAME WAS WANG.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These superstitions connected with the utterance of a name
are deeply rooted among the Borneans, but the interdiction on
the speaking of names of relatives is not so extended as it is
among some other primitive people, notably the Kaffir women
of South Africa, who may not speak a word, or even a word containing
a syllable, resembling their husband’s name or the names
of any of his male relatives, but must use paraphrases which do
not contain the interdicted syllables.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Among the Kayans and
Kenyahs, as far as I know, the restriction on the utterance of
names of relatives extends only to the fathers-in-law of a married
couple, whose names must not be mentioned by either the husband
or the wife. Again, it is most ill-omened for a son to mention
his dead father’s name; and, of course, neither man nor
woman dare pronounce their own name; this is a downright
courting of all conceivable disasters and diseases. It is quite
possible that this unwillingness to mention their own name leads
them to adopt a substitution, which for every-day use sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
designates them. Thus, when a child is born the parents substitute
for their own names the name of the child prefixed by ‘Tama,’—<i>father
of</i>,—or ‘Tina,’—<i>mother of</i>,—a highly ingenious device;
the combination thus formed is really no name at all; it is merely
a designation. On the same principle, when wife or husband dies
the survivor is designated as ‘Aban,’—<i>widower</i>,—or ‘Bállo,’—<i>widow</i>,—of
such a one. The simple-hearted folk evidently
believe the Spirits to be the very strictest of constructionists,
and that they pay no attention to anything but the name itself,
pure and uncombined; to a substitution they pay no heed.</p>

<p>One might suppose that under such circumstances it would
be rather more convenient, certainly far less hazardous, to have
no name at all. But without a name there would be no existence,—how
could a nameless thing be admitted to ‘Apo Legan,’ or
Heaven? The receiving of a name is really the starting-point
of life; and the bestowal of a name by the parents is probably
the most serious of parental duties, and to be performed with
ceremonies proportioned to their rank. So essential is the ceremony
of naming that in the enumeration of a family an unnamed
child is not counted; and should a child die before the ceremony
of naming, a Kayan or Kenyah mother would mourn for it no more
deeply than had it been stillborn. This is true even when an
unnamed child lives to be nearly a year old.</p>

<p>Children of the labouring classes are named at the completion
of what the father considers a successful harvest of rice; and the
day is set for the ceremony when the phase of the moon is
deemed auspicious; the rest of the household, with the exception
of the few friends who assist, is undisturbed. When, however,
the son of a Chief is to be named, and thereby admitted into the
circle of kindred or into humanity, the occasion is made a holiday,
and a feast-day for the whole community, and friendly households
far and near for miles around are summoned to attend. It was
on such an occasion as this, that we, Dr. Hiller and myself, had
the rare fortune to be the visitors of Tama Bulan, the most influential
Chief in the Baram District of Sarawak.</p>

<p>We had but recently come to Borneo when we first met
Tama Bulan at the Baram Fort, whither he had come to attend
a peacemaking and ratification of friendship with certain
Ibans who had recently moved into the district, and also to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
barter at the Bazaar the rattans, raw gutta-percha, and camphor
that his people had collected. We were much impressed with
the sedate dignity of this inland Chief and the quiet demeanor
of his people, and greatly desired to become more thoroughly
acquainted with them. As he was sitting cross-legged on the
veranda of Dr. Hose’s bungalow and discussing the affairs of the
up-river people, he mentioned with pride that as soon as he
reached home there were to be great feastings and ceremonies
over the naming of his only son. Here was the chance of a life-time
could we but induce him to let us be present during these
ceremonies. We were totally unacquainted with Tama Bulan’s
language,—the Kenyah,—or even with Malay, the Lingua Franca
throughout Borneo and the greater part of the adjacent islands,—but
what of that? Sign language is all sufficient at a pinch,
and, furthermore, a vocabulary of a hundred and fifty to two hundred
words is soon acquired, and, in simple Polynesian dialects,
will prove adequate for all ordinary purposes. I doubt if any
Caucasian has ever witnessed these ceremonies as observed by
the Kenyahs; at any rate, as far as I know, they have never
been recorded; accordingly, we strenuously urged Dr. Hose to
obtain for us an invitation. When he, finally, with much tact,
told the Kenyah Chief how anxious we were to return with him
and pay him a visit in his home, the proposal was listened to
with unusual gravity. Tama Bulan’s keen black eyes studied us
very carefully from head to foot; evidently he was weighing the
chances of possible accidents either to us or to his people. At
last he broke silence, and, having in mind the dangerous rapids
in the river, his first question was, ‘Can the Tuans [<i>gentlemen</i>]
swim?’ When assured that we were adepts in that art, he deliberated
again for a while, and then asked, ‘How can we get along
without talking? the Tuans cannot speak my language, nor can
I speak theirs.’ This objection was put aside by Dr. Hose, who
flatteringly rejoined, ‘Ah, Tama Bulan does not know the power
of the white man as well as I thought he did. The Tuans are
so clever that in two days they will be able to speak your
language as well as you do yourself; everything is easy to a
white man.’ Whereat Tama Bulan smiled broadly, and, after
another searching gaze, consented to let us return with him,—provided
the government would not hold him responsible for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
any accidents. And so it was agreed, and the matter settled.
But for some time my conscience did not acquit me of the
conviction that we had forced ourselves unwarrantably on an
unwilling host; however, I solaced myself with the cheering
reflection that we could amply recompense him at the close of
our visit.</p>

<p>Tama Bulan is a Chief of the Kenyah tribe, and his home is
between three and four hundred miles in the interior of the island,
on the Pata River, a tributary of the Baram. His house is one
of the largest and best built in that large district, and is, moreover,
conducted on rigid principles of Kenyah morality. Of
course, in such a community theft is unknown, where every one
knows every article of property belonging to the others. Thieving
being thus eliminated, one of the strictest rules in Tama
Bulan’s house is that no woman, young or old, shall frequent the
veranda after nightfall; young girls must remain in their family
apartments, and if they have sweethearts they must entertain
these sweethearts there, and not sit sentimentally with them in
convenient dark corners, whereof there is no lack in a veranda.
Another of Tama Bulan’s rules is wisely sanitary, namely, that
no rice may be hulled in the veranda; the dust arising from the
chaff is not only irritating to the nostrils, but is also apt to produce
an itching rash on the skins of young children and infants.
To each family is apportioned a small shed at the back of the
house for the threshing and hulling of the rice; and where,
moreover, the workers are to a certain degree secluded, and not
liable to distraction and idleness as they would be in a veranda.</p>

<p>Tama Bulan himself is one of the best types of a Bornean
Chief. Although only about five or six years ago he was a passionate
head-hunter (and is still, I believe, in his heart of heart,
having been carefully and religiously brought up by his parents),
he is now a genuinely loyal and highly valuable subject to Rajah
Brooke, and has been made a member of the ‘Council Negri,’ a
legislative body composed of the Rajah, of the English Resident
Officers of the first class, of several of the most influential Malays
in Kuching, the capital of Sarawak, and of three or four of the
most trustworthy and intelligent of the native Chiefs. This
Council Negri, one of the admirable devices of that wise legislator,
Rajah Brooke, meets once a year to discuss what might be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
termed national affairs, and to lay before the Rajah all complaints
or suggestions.</p>

</figure>

<p>Our host, with whom we became eventually intimately
acquainted, and of whom I became very fond, (his staunch friendship
on one occasion saved our lives,) was a man of about forty-five,
well built, but not muscular in appearance, about five feet six
inches tall, his face broad, cheek bones somewhat high, eyes
wide apart, lips thin, and mouth large but well shaped; his
smile is ready, kind, and benignant, and his laugh reveals two
rows of polished, regular, and highly blackened teeth. In his
general expression there is not the least suggestion of what we
are pleased to term a savage; his demeanor was quiet, unobtrusive,
and dignified, and his voice soft and subdued. In
obedience to fashion (to whose behests every son of Adam is a
slave) his ear-lobes are pierced, and by means of heavy copper
rings, inserted in early infancy, are so elongated that they
almost touch his shoulder. The upper part of each ear is also
perforated, so as to permit the insertion of a tiger-cat’s tooth;
this ornament is, however, inserted only for full dress; in every-day
life a plug of wood about half an inch in diameter is substituted.
These ‘looped and windowed’ ears serve, in the lack
of clothing, as pockets, and are extremely convenient receptacles
of cigarettes, or even of boxes of matches. His head is
shaved in a straight line extending horizontally from one temple
to another, but his straight, black hair is allowed to grow long
at the back. I describe Tama Bulan thus somewhat at length
because he is a typical and pure-blooded Kenyah.</p>

<p>The skin of the Kenyahs and Kayans is not yellow, but somewhat
darker than a Chinaman’s; they have none of the characteristics
of the thick-lipped African negro, nor have they the
bushy, krinkly hair of the Papuans; nor the almond eyes, or the
stretched inner canthus of the Mongolians.</p>

<p>On ordinary occasions, they wear nothing but a loin-cloth,
made either of bark fibre of native manufacture, or of red, white,
or black cotton cloth, bought from Chinese traders in the
Bazaar (the Malay name for a trading-post). On their heads
they wear a close-fitting, pointed cap made of thin strips of rattan,
(or ‘rotan’ as they call it,) or of bamboo woven into a pretty
chequered pattern of black and yellow; when exposed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
sun they often exchange this skull cap for a broad, flat disc made
of palm leaves and tied to the head.</p>

<p>In order that we might not burden Tama Bulan and his canoes
with our heavy luggage of several boxes of tinned provisions,
cooking utensils, and not a few articles for judicious presents,
such as tobacco, bolts of cheap cotton cloth, and a quantity of
steel bars, wherefrom the natives forge parangs and spear-heads,
Dr. Hose kindly lent his large dug-out, which afforded
comfortable quarters for ourselves and also (a pleasant arrangement)
for our host, the Chief. The dug-out was about sixty
feet long and five feet wide amidship, made of a single log,
but deepened considerably by the addition of planks bound
along the sides with rattan and caulked, thus giving about six
inches of additional freeboard. The party consisted of eight
canoes, bearing Tama Bulan’s followers, and as they swung into
view after their start from the Bazaar, a short distance below Dr.
Hose’s bungalow, which stands on a high and steep bluff, they
shouted to us and loudly rapped their paddles on the sides of
the canoes, by way of urging us to hurry down to the bank, so
great was their impatience to be fairly started on the homeward
voyage. We had divided the central third of the canoe into two
compartments, separated from each other by our luggage, sleeping
mats, mosquito curtains, etc.; in the forward division we took
up our quarters, reserving the aft division for Tama Bulan, who
seemed to fill and overflow it with his shields, parangs, large sun-hats,
bundles and baskets packed with cheap cloths, Malay
sarongs, heavy copper ear-rings, pressed glass bowls, and beads
of every description,—all commissions executed for his household
and received in exchange for jungle products. Where, or
how he managed to sleep I cannot imagine,—but he was the
Chief, and uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. As for us,
we were really comfortable with rubber blankets and thick rugs
spread over the flooring of bamboo strips which rested on the
thwarts amidship, except that after awhile, as sitting cross-legged
became misery, we longed for a chance to dangle our legs. Overhead
was a roof of ‘kajangs’—a thin thatch of palm leaves—to
protect us from the sun and rain. As soon as the canoe was all
packed, and our Chinese cook and two Malay servants were
properly ensconced in other canoes, and it took a deal of excited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
shouting and innumerable shiftings before this was accomplished
to the satisfaction of the crew of each canoe, the word was given,
and with a few powerful strokes from the paddles which sent the
spray dashing and the water eddying all about us, we were round
the turn of the river and had bid adieu to even such comfort and
civilization as the Baram Bazaar affords, and had fairly started on
this journey to the far interior of Borneo, with its untold possibilities,
at the mercy of unknown natives, of whose very language
we knew not a word.</p>

<p>Until the central high-lands of Borneo are reached, the river
scenery is utterly uninteresting and monotonous; near the coast,
where the river water is still brackish, the banks are lined with
the feathery Nipa palm with fronds like stiff ferns, often forty
feet high. These palms have no stalk, but start in a cluster close
to the ground or just at the surface of the water, and grow so
close together as to make an almost impenetrable wall. At first
they appear beyond measure beautiful, with their polished, glancing
leaves, quivering and wavering with every breath of air; and
the gleam of the dark maroon mid-rib of the leaves swaying slowly
with the motion adds a flickering light to the deep shadows,
suggestive of mystery through the illimitable aisles beneath the
over-arching fronds. But a closer acquaintance reveals the
realm of crocodiles and snakes, not to mention the unromantic
mosquito, diminutive in size but mighty to annoy. [Once on a
time, in the salad days of my Borneo life, I tried to take a photograph
in the depth of a Nipa swamp, but indeed, the torment
of the myriads of rapacious and voracious mosquitoes which
attacked me while making the necessary exposure was absolutely
intolerable. When I threw the focussing cloth over my head I
entrapped unwittingly so many mosquitoes that I could hardly
see to focus; in one minute they had stung me on the lips,
cheeks, eyelids, within the nostrils, and on the ears. I am not a
coward, but I really could not face, literally, the overwhelming
onslaught for the two minutes which, on account of the dim
light, were necessary for the exposure; the poor wretch of an
Iban who was with me, clad only in his loin-cloth, actually
cried and moaned with the suffering; my negative turned out
to have been under-exposed because both of us had been over-exposed.]
After twenty or thirty miles of this unbroken wall of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Nipa palms the charm diminishes, until at last all beauty is lost
in satiety and the sight becomes infinitely tedious. It is, by the
way, from these Nipa palms thus growing in brackish water that
the natives obtain salt; the ashes of the stalks, leaves, and roots
are soaked in water, which, when the water is evaporated, yields
a very dirty looking salt, much preferred, however, by the natives
to that which can be bought in the Bazaar. Where the Nipa
palms end wild sugar-cane begins, and its gray-green, grassy
stalks become quite as monotonous as the Nipa; it is not until
the low muddy banks of the river change, first to sandy and then
to pebbly beaches, that the real beauty of the river begins.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the exciting novelty of our situation I cannot
say that that first day passed quickly, or that it was full of
interest; a day is a long time when it is spent hour after hour in
gliding along a wall of unvarying green. Tama Bulan’s last purchase
at the Bazaar was a Chinese tea ‘cosy’—a little cylindrical
basket lined with felt, holding a small teapot closely fitted and
keeping the tea hot for a long time. Every five minutes, as it
seemed, we heard the click of the hasp; then the creak of the
cover as the teapot was lifted out; then a loud and prolonged
sucking sound as Tama Bulan luxuriously drained with infinite
gusto a diminutive cup of tea. I am quite sure that the teapot
was so often replenished from the river that it yielded, finally,
nothing but tepid and muddy water,—but ah! the charm of
drinking from a china teapot and quaffing with an ecstatic gurgle!
The old Chief often peered through a little crevice in the pile of
luggage between us, and then he would chuckle and give vent to
a flow of words which bubbled out so fluently between his broad
smile and his blackened teeth that they seemed to stumble over
themselves and end off in fit of coughing. We smiled, nodded,
mumbled, and pretended to understand it all,—even the cough.</p>

<p>Toward dusk of the first day we halted at a sloping sand-bank,
enclosed on three sides by a dense hedge of wild sugar-cane,
full of mysterious rustlings and sighings, and stretching far
over the low ground to the beginning of the jungle. The other
boats of our party were already tied up to the shore, and the
brown-skinned men in their scarlet waist-cloths were bustling
about collecting fire-wood and building cranes whereon to hang
their little kettles of rice. A row of fires was soon started, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the short twilight of the tropics deepened into dark; the dancing
fires cast giant shadows on the gray-green leaves of the wild
sugar-cane, and lit up the intent faces of the natives and their
glistening eyes and brass-studded teeth as they squatted about
the fires or stirred the bubbling pots. When the meal was ended
and they were smoking long cigarettes of Java tobacco rolled in
the dried leaf of the wild banana, the moon rose and the embers
of the fires were scattered. To become more at home with our
hosts and fellow travellers we entered into their games and contests
in broad jumping, high jumping, and tugs of war. Alas
for me, I was indiscreet enough to turn a handspring for them,
and also walk on my hands, feats that apparently were perfectly
new to them; ever after I was introduced by Tama Bulan to his
friends with the laudatory remark that I could walk on my hands
and turn over; whereupon, be it on muddy bank or hard floor,
I was incontinently obliged to repeat the performance.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>SCENE ON THE BARAM</p>

<p>A RAFT BRINGING RATTANS TO THE BAZAAR.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When the Chief retired to his boat it was the signal for the
general breaking up of the pastime. Grass mats were brought
from the boats and spread on the sand, whereon the men threw
themselves, and, in the soft light of the tropical moon, we were
all soon lulled to sleep by the constant drone and chirp of nocturnal
insects.</p>

<p>Early the next morning we awoke and saw, by the light of the
setting moon, the men shaking out their mats and making
preparations for starting off. We were soon under way once
more, and between waking and sleeping we were conscious of
the rhythmical click of the paddles and of an occasional command
of ‘Mishai! Mishai!’ from Tama Bulan to the rowers to
wield their paddles stronger and faster.</p>

<p>It is not worth while to give in detail all the long fifteen days
of our journey up the river, or of our visits to the various houses
on our way; as may be readily inferred, there were many hours,
monotonous, weary, and at times perplexing; three men died of
the grippe,—which seems to have penetrated this most remote
corner of the world, and was at that time fairly epidemic on the
Baram. Unfortunately for us, these deaths were attributed to
our presence; a council was held, and we were, in consequence,
requested to return; but we protested our innocence, asseverated
our friendship, and having already come so far begged to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
allowed to go on, and finally allayed their fears and gained their
consent. We distributed tobacco and medicine freely, and held
numerous clinics in our boat and on the river-banks, for the
treatment of a troublesome inflammation of the eyes, probably due
to the depilation of eyelashes, added to constant bathing in the
muddy, turbid river. At one time the rains descended and the
floods came, and for five mortal days we were tied up to the bank
of the river, unable to advance on account of the irresistible current
and of the immense logs and trees that were constantly
brought down by the stream. During this enforced inactivity
we became better and better acquainted with our companions; we
learned their names and a generous smattering of their language,—an
easy task; we powdered many and many a wound and abrasion
with iodoform, whereof the color and smell delighted them, and
brought us greatly into favor. From the boys who accompanied
the party, and who acted as general ‘slaveys,’ we picked up most
of our familiarity with the language; they were always ready to
talk unconstrainedly with us, and we amused ourselves while
amusing them. One little fellow in particular we never grew
tired of watching; his actions were as quick and inquisitive as
those of a monkey, with the added revelation of a shrewd intelligence.
I blush to confess that we taught him the bad manners
of putting his thumb to his nose and wiggling his fingers
whenever his elders told him to do anything for them; the outraged
indignation with which this perfectly novel and insulting
gesture was received, and the sly winks little Adom gave us over
his shoulder, at every repetition, were truly delightful. One day
we painted him from head to foot, with water colors, in stripes
of blue, green, yellow, and black, to his joyous delight; and
although he was greeted with outbursts of laughter by the
whole party, he was, nevertheless, exceedingly reluctant to wash
off his decoration. Lishun was another of our particular
‘pals,’ and a sturdier, braver little fellow it would be hard to find;
he was certainly not over eight or nine years old, but on many
occasions he saved our canoe from being swept back round a
sharp turn of the river where the current ran at headlong speed.
Just as the men were losing all hold with their poles and the bow
of the canoe was inevitably swinging out toward the middle of
the river, Lishun, with a rattan rope attached to the bow, in one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
hand, would plunge into the swirl of water, and, disappearing for
a breathless moment, would emerge among the roots and branches
on the river-bank, with a shout of laughter from pure enjoyment,
and there make fast his rope, while the polers with a fresh hold
brought the bow of the canoe to the right direction. Why his
little limbs were not torn to pieces and his body battered against
the rocks in that seething, whirling water is to be explained, I
suppose, only by the fact that water was almost as much his
element as the earth or air. Then there were Terluat, a solemn
little fellow, who preferred listening to talking; Apoi, a fat and
greasy lumpkin with an inane giggle if you did but look at
him; Deng, about sixteen years old, as clean-limbed and symmetrical
an example of adolescence as can be imagined; and Gau,
an ugly little monkey-faced boy, but as bright as a new penny
and an expert in cat’s-cradle. Blari, Tama Bulan’s nephew, and
Tama Talun, the Chief’s right-hand man and a kind of ‘master
of ceremonies,’ were our particular friends among the men, apart
from the Chief, Tama Bulan, himself.</p>

</figure>

<p>During the weary days of waiting for the floods to subside, we
used the youngsters to teach us their language, and never missed
the opportunity of having them in our boat, where we could
make the idle moments pass in showing them a collection of
illustrated papers that we had brought with us. One evening,
after they had been giving us a concert of their own music, we
tried what effect some of our songs would have on them. Somewhat
to my surprise, such melodies as ‘The Suwanee River’ and
‘The Old Kentucky Home’ possessed not the smallest charm
for them; they evidently thought our style of singing exceedingly
amusing,—perhaps it was; and they made no attempt to
restrain their laughter. Afterward we heard them trying to
imitate it by merely a continuous rise and fall of voice in a high
key. One song, however, did appeal to them as more like their
own; this was ‘Three Old Crows Sat on a Stone’ with the
refrain of ‘Jimmy Magee Magaw;’ frequent repetitions were
called for; and finally they caught the air and adapted words of
their own to it, with a refrain of ‘Balli Boin Akán,’ a phrase
wherewith the Dayongs, or priests, address pigs that are about
to be sacrificed.</p>

<p>At the end of five days, during which the freshet acquired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
daily and nightly new strength from heavy thunder-showers, the
Omen Birds, the guides and guardians of these people, were
harangued and alternately cajoled and threatened. At one time
a fruitless attempt was made to deceive them. The whole party
disembarked, and, donning their spears and parangs, made a wide
circuit in the jungle, so as to make the birds believe that the
canoes were not going home, but were on an ordinary hunting
expedition. Once Tama Bulan, while sitting in our canoe, shook
his fist at a bird perched on a bough near by, and upbraided it for
not causing the rain to cease. When he observed our interest in
his proceedings his face broke into an embarrassed smile, and he
poked me in the ribs, and said, chuckling, ‘Tuan does not
believe in the birds, does he? He thinks Tama Bulan is crazy.’
I assured him that when in Borneo the white man was as much
under the protection of the birds as were the natives themselves,
which was equivocal, but gratifying to his belief. On another
occasion both Dr. Hiller and myself were sprinkled with water
from a stick cut into shavings at one end and held on the blade
of a parang. Had the skies immediately cleared, it would have
afforded such irrefragable proof of our league with evil Spirits
that I know not what would have been our fate. But at last the
waters fell, and, finally, we reached the mouth of the Pata River,
the large tributary whereon Tama Bulan lives; and then after
three days of hard boating over rapids which necessitated our
disembarking twice and carrying our boat and all our baggage
overland for a short distance, we arrived within one turn of the
river from Tama Bulan’s house. Here a halt for final purification
was made. An arch of boughs about five feet high was erected
on the beach, and beneath it a fire was kindled, and then Tama
Bulan, holding a young chicken, which he waved and brushed
over every portion of the arch, invoked all evil Spirits which had
been accompanying us, and forbade them to follow us further
through the fire. The fowl was then killed, its blood smeared
all over the archway and sprinkled in the fire; then, led by
Tama Bulan, the whole party filed under the arch, and as they
stepped over the fire each one spat in it vociferously and immediately
took his place in the boats.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> A half hour more brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
us to the huge log which serves as a landing along the shore
below the house of Tama Bulan.</p>

<p>(From a photograph taken, and kindly loaned, by Professor A. C. Haddon, F. R. S.)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Tama Bulan did all in his power to show us that we were
welcome, and assigned to us an immense slab of Tapang wood
about eight feet square and suspended about three feet above the
floor by beams from the roof; hereon we could spread our mats
at night and keep our possessions out of the reach of the hungry
mongrel dogs that pervaded the veranda. As soon as we were
thus properly shelved, and had our things stowed away comfortably,
our host came and requested us to visit him in his private
apartment and meet his family. With much pride he conducted
us into the presence of his daughter, Bulan, who had gathered
about her a bevy of her intimate girl friends, all busily engaged
in making cigarettes; she received us with quiet dignity, but,
owing to our lack of proficiency in Malay, I must acknowledge
that the conversation could not be termed particularly brilliant.
However, we did our best to be entertaining; Dr. Hiller and
myself displayed the elaborate Japanese tattooing on our arms,
and I sprung by hand, at her father’s instigation, into Bulan’s
good graces. She was about seventeen or eighteen years old,
with a strong resemblance to her father, and mild, gentle eyes
which she slowly opened and shut with demure solemnity; her
teeth were, of course, blackened; her hair was parted in the
middle, and brought down low in glossy black waves over her
forehead and held in place by a fillet of plaited rattan; her eyebrows
and eyelashes had been either shaved or depilated. The
one ineradicable blemish in her beauty is her left ear; over-ambitious
parents had suspended therein too heavy weights
when she was young, and one beautiful ear-lobe had given away;
to be sure, it had been patched and reunited, but the patch was
undeniable, and an ugly lump the result. Alas! even three hundred
miles in the heart of Borneo <i>il faut souffrir pour être
belle</i>. I showed her some of the pictures of American men and
women in the Magazines we had with us; she was much amused
at the small waists of the women, which I was obliged to tell
her were effected by steel bands laced tightly about them. This
was incomprehensible to her, and the torture which she inferred
excited her sympathy. In every picture where neither beard nor
moustache marked the sex I had to tell her which were men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
and which were women; she could see no difference in the faces,
and the dress and coiffure had no meaning to her.</p>

<p>We were next shown the little son and heir who was to be
the centre of the coming festivities; he was the whitest Bornean
baby that I ever saw, his skin was what might be called a dark-cream
color. Infant as he was,—not yet a year old,—he evinced
the utmost terror at the sight of us, and emitted such bawls that
he had to be carried away quickly. His ears, even at that early
age, had been slit, and were already quite elongated with large
bunches of pewter rings, which were, in fact, his sole article of
dress. It always seemed strange to see babies in arms carried
about without a rag of clothing on them; long clothes are
so indissolubly associated in our minds with infancy that there
seemed to be something monstrous and discordant in a tender
little baby continually stark naked. This baby, in spite of its
bad temper, was, however, the idol of the household; nephews,
nieces, friends, and slaves of its parents were all proud to be
allowed to carry it about the veranda, in its sling hung with
charms.</p>

<p>While we were away on a five days’ visit to another Chief on
the Apoh River, Tama Bulan most hospitably caused to be constructed
for us in the veranda, nearly opposite his apartment, a
little room partitioned off by matting and a wall of bamboo rods,
wherein, as he explained, we should be free from the annoyance
of children and dogs; but even while he was speaking a row of
little, beady eyes peering at us through the cracks between the
bamboos made me sympathize with the feelings of the <i>freaks</i> at
a circus when the small boy lifts the flaps of the tent.</p>

<p>On the day of our arrival, the only indication of the approaching
festivities were hundreds of bunches of bananas, suspended
everywhere from the roof; but when we returned from the Apoh
River, preparations were already in full swing for the Naming,
and we contributed freely from our store of tobacco for the
manufacture of cigarettes. Bulan’s room was the centre of this
industry, and the workers, all women and girls, occupied every
inch of the floor, squatting in groups round baskets piled high
with the stringy weed. While some prepared the dried banana
leaves, others rolled the cigarettes; some rolled them on their
thighs, others on polished boards held in their laps. It was a merry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
gathering, with a constant buzz of gossip, and now and then loud
bursts of innocent laughter that bespake the vacant mind. The
holiday had already begun, and during the days devoted to the
ceremonies there is no work in the rice-fields, consequently the
house was full of young people who would be, at other times,
hard at work out of doors. The small boy was, of course,
ubiquitous,—as, on similar busy occasions, he is in civilized
countries; and little Adom seemed to be everywhere at every
instant, upsetting baskets of tobacco, purloining rolls of banana
leaf, dropping chips and rubbish from rafters above on the heads
of the workers beneath, and at every turn in everybody’s way;
nevertheless he was treated with uniform forbearance, and only
occasional playful sallies from the girls kept him from downright
hindering them in their work. Kindliness and hilarity ruled the
hour.</p>

</figure>

<p>As fast as the cigarettes were made they were strung on a
thread and hung, a dangling fringe, on a framework of rattans
about six feet long, representing a horn-bill with his wings outspread.
The head was carved of wood and painted, so that
it had a most life-like appearance, and in addition it was ornamented
with several strips of bead-work cloth draped around it
and enveloping the neck; its tail was composed of real feathers
with the broad black band. The cigarettes were hung almost as
closely as feathers all over the body, wings, and tail,—indeed,
there must have been a thousand affixed to it. When the last
cigarette was hung in place, and it took far into the night before
the whole was finished, the huge bird was suspended from a
rafter beyond the reach of pilfering hands, until the proper time
for distribution.</p>

<p>In deciding the exact date for the important ceremony of
naming the son of a Chief, the phase of the moon is of vital
importance. According to the Kenyah calendar, the moon passes
through twelve phases, whereof only two or three are really
auspicious; and when some are in the ascendant they prognosticate
even downright ill luck to all who are then named. These
phases are as follows (‘bulan,’ meaning <i>moon</i>): (1) ‘Bulan musit,’
<i>the birth of the moon</i>; (2) ‘Bulan anak,’ <i>the moon has a child</i>;
(3) ‘Bulan dyipu boin,’ <i>the pig’s tooth moon</i>; (4) ‘Bulan bakwong,’
<i>the bird’s-bill moon</i>; (5) ‘Bulan petak,’ <i>moon of sickness</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
(6) ‘Bulan batak-palan,’ <i>the fish moon</i>, moderately good, but not
auspicious for building houses; (7) ‘Bulan salap jiit’ and (8)
‘Bulan salap bioh,’ <i>the big</i> and <i>the little belly-moons</i>; both good
moons; the ‘Salap bioh’ is the best for naming children. (9)
‘Bulan loong-payong jiit,’ <i>moon of the small payong fruit</i>; (10)
‘Bulan loong-payong bioh,’ <i>moon of the big payong fruit</i>; these
two phases are auspicious for almost any undertaking. (11)
‘Bulan blasong jiit,’ <i>moon of the small pearl shell</i> (the shell often
attached to the front of a war-coat); this is also an auspicious
phase. (12) ‘Bulan blasong bioh,’ <i>moon of the big pearl shell</i>,—<i>i.e.</i>,
full moon; this is considered not a very favorable phase. A
child born under it goes to extremes. It is either very intelligent
or else an idiot. Fighting and trouble are most apt to occur
during the full moon.</p>

<p>The usual age at which a child is named is at about the end
of the first year or at the beginning of the second. Up to this
time all the children, especially those of a Chief, are under a
‘lali,’ a word signifying a <i>restriction</i>, and used in the same sense
as taboo. As long as this lali is in force the child must not be
bathed in the river, but in the private apartment of its parents;
it must not be carried even down the ladder from the house to
the ground; even to mention its future name is so ill-omened as
to be prohibitory; it is known only by the indefinite appellation
‘Angat’ if a boy, and ‘Endun’ if a girl,—Angat means literally
<i>a little worm</i>; what Endun means, if it have a separate meaning,
I do not know. On the present occasion, the moon was in the
phase of Salap bioh, the big-bellied moon,—that is, gibbous.</p>

<p>Numerous guests now began to arrive to participate in the
ceremonies; they came so quietly, and so little commotion followed
their arrival, that we were hardly aware of their presence
until we noticed the large groups outside of Tama Bulan’s door.</p>

<p>On the morning of the appointed day, alternate blows on two
large gongs gave notice that the ceremony was about to begin.
We filed into the Chief’s room with the others, and, passing
through the narrow and dark little entry with its very ramshackle
floor, we found the family and the guests sitting cross-legged
about a large mat in the middle of the room. In the centre of
this mat was a heap about a foot high of white husked rice; at
one side of this heap sat the proud mother, holding the pale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
little son and heir. When we were all seated, the gongs
redoubled and trebled their din, to drown all sounds of evil
portent while the rites take place.</p>

<p>It is the first duty of the Dayong, or priestess, (on this occasion
Tama Bulan’s first wife, the mother of Bulan,) to drive away
all evil Spirits which may be perchance still lurking near the
child. Old age is seldom, if ever, beautiful in Borneo, and as
old Tina Bulan stood up to officiate, with her straggly hanks of
swarthy hair, her blackened snags of teeth, her shrivelled, bony
arms and corded neck, she looked the supreme incarnation of a
witch, straight from the ‘pit of Acheron.’ But ugliness, as well
as beauty, is only skin deep; and we learned to know this Tina
Bulan as a dear old soul, as kind and good-natured as mortal
can be.</p>

<p>She held by its legs a young chicken, which, with excited
gesticulations, she waved above and about the little stark-naked,
bawling baby, struggling in its mother’s lap, and as she waved
she dipped water from a bowl, and, sprinkling it upon the fowl,
exhorted it, as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Misau balli yap!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Balli Isit! balli Sakit!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Misau balli Mibang nelatang,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Balli nupi jiat, iya malat!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ja! dua! talu! pat!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pat porat petat, peti pasi balli jiat!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Which, somewhat freely translated, means, ‘Drive away, O
hallowed fowl, and hallowed Isit [omen bird], all sickness and
evil Spirits that surround us! Render harmless all bad dreams!
One! two! three! four! Away, all evil demons, here, there, and
everywhere!’</p>

<p>As she counted ja! dua! talu! pat! she waved her hands
violently and threateningly, as if fairly pushing the evil Spirits
from her. Trembling with excitement, she then dropped cross-legged
close to the heap of snow-white rice, and with a bamboo
joint measured out eight portions; out of these, she made a separate
pile at one side. Eight measures of rice are the portion for
the child of a Chief, half that number suffices ordinary children.
The rice, thus measured, is for the god, Penylong, the guardian
of all souls, and for his wife, Perbungan; the spiritual essence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
alone of the grains goes to the gods; the ceremony over, the rice
may be eaten by mortals. In the middle of this lesser pile of
rice she planted a small sprig of a tree, called the <i>tree of life</i>,
‘Kayu urip;’ with this symbol in front of her, she carefully
picked out from the pile eight full, well-shaped grains; wrapping
them in a strip of bark-fibre, and holding the strip close above
the child’s head, she tied a knot in it enclosing and holding fast
the grains. (This strip thus knotted is called ‘Tebuku urip.’)
Eight times was this repeated, and all the while the brazen gongs
kept up their hideous, deafening din; now and then, when the
wearied performers stopped for a moment to change hands, the
vigorous and well-sustained bawling of the noble infant filled the
gap. Once I caught sight of little Adom sliding stealthily down
from his perch on the rack for bamboo water-bottles, whence he
had been enjoying his wonted bird’s eye view of the whole performance,
and, seizing the arm of a tired gong-beater, his little
dust-begrimed face all contorted with earnestness, helped him to
beat louder.</p>

<p>Every time that Tina Bulan enclosed in a knot the eight
grains of rice, she murmured: ‘May your soul live long, and,
by the omens of this knotted cord of life, may you live to a
venerable old age!’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>If each grain of rice mean a year of life, the reckoning does
not fall far short of the Biblical three score and ten.</p>

<p>When the ceremony was completed of the Tebuku urip (where
‘urip’ means <i>of life</i>), the ‘Kayu urip’ (<i>the tree of life</i>) was placed
in a joint of bamboo, wherein also the tebuku itself was stored.
The bamboo joint is assigned only to a man-child; out of bamboo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
are made tobacco-boxes, and quivers for the poisoned
darts of the blow-pipe. Such things are carried only by men,
never by women.</p>

</figure>

<p>At the naming of a girl, the Kayu urip and the Tebuku are
placed in a small basket, like those wherein rice is carried; this
symbolises women’s work in the rice-fields.</p>

<p>These symbols are hung up in the child’s room, over the
sleeping-place, and are ever after venerated.</p>

<p>The moment that Tina Bulan had placed the Kayu urip and
the Tebuku in the bamboo joint the gongs ceased, and I think a
sigh of relief swept over the whole assembly. Thus far no
sound of evil omen had been heard; indeed, any malevolent
lizard or rancorous frog, in order to make his fateful croak audible
above the indescribable din of those fearsome gongs, would
have to employ a siren whistle with megaphone attachment.</p>

<p>The little baby was now danced and jiggled and carried about
in its sling to stop its wailing. Several young girls and old
women handed round on flat baskets, heaps of little packages of
salt and ginger-root wrapped in pieces of green banana leaf;
these, together with two or three bananas, they distributed to
each guest.</p>

<p>Tama Talun, who sat beside me on the floor throughout the
ceremony, and with genuine courtesy explained from time to time
what was going on, told me that the salt, the ginger, and the
sweet banana indicated what it was hoped would be the future
disposition of the child, namely, he should be duly calm, hot, and
gentle, never sluggish nor apathetic. Of course, I opened my
package, ate a pinch of salt, nibbled the ginger-root, and wished
the while good luck to the babe; then cheerfully pledged him
in a cup of arrack, which was also passed to each guest. This
apparently completed the ceremonies of the first day for Tama
Bulan, Junior (I cannot call him by his real name; what that was,
as yet not a soul but his father and mother knew). The women
all arose and began to file out of the room; wishing not to miss
anything, I too rose up, and was slowly making my way among
them to the door when I became aware of an unusual amount
of giggling around me, nay, of several explosions of laughter
from the men in the room behind me. I turned about and
saw all their faces on a broad grin. What ridiculous breach of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
etiquette had I committed? I paused, and good-natured Tama
Talun came to my rescue, shouting out over the heads of the
rest, ‘Go on, Tuan, it’s all right; they are only foolishly laughing
because the Tuan seems to think he is a woman. We men have
to stay behind until all the women get into the next room.’
With the exception of Dr. Hiller, I was the only one in that
dusky assemblage that could blush; my cheeks and forehead at
once fulfilled their duty, and I gently edged out of the crowd.</p>

<p>It is usual, on the naming-day of a Chief’s son, to bestow
names on all the babies of a befitting age in the house; advantage
must be taken of the same auspicious day. Therefore as
soon as the ceremony was thus far completed in Tama Bulan’s
room, there was a second wild uproar of gongs a little further
down the veranda, and to this room the guests all repaired.
There, the same ceremonies were repeated, except, as I mentioned
before, only four measures of rice were apportioned for
the humbler folk; but, nevertheless, eight grains were tied up in
each knot of the Tebuku.</p>

<p>Thus it went on throughout that whole day; the guests wandering
from room to room, tasting pinches of salt, nibbling ginger,
sipping arrack, and stuffing themselves with bananas; between
whiles cooling off by bathing in the river.</p>

<p>The rites of the first day are but preliminary to the more
august ceremonies of the second day, which are conducted in
public outside the Chief’s room, in the veranda, opposite to his
door, where all the household and guests can assemble to welcome
the youngster as soon as his name is proclaimed.</p>

<p>When the morning meal was over, the strong young men of
the household, provided with rattan ropes, descended to the
muddy wallows among the massive upright posts that support the
house, and began at once to give chase to the pigs. These
knowing, omen-yielding animals perform a highly important part
in the rites, but they pay the dear forfeit of their lives for the
privilege; they seemed verily to suspect, on the present occasion,
the fate in store for them, and, at an early hour, had ungraciously
betaken themselves to the woods. An hour passed, then
another, and then another,—and no hunter with his pig had
returned. Tama Bulan gradually became greatly worried, and
kept reiterating that no one could estimate how evil would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
the omen if the large pig which he had destined for this ceremony
could not be found. At last, however, cheering shouts were
heard from the neighboring jungle, and, soon after, one by one,
the pigs, six or seven in number, with <i>the</i> pig to the fore, were
brought up to the veranda, slung on poles, with their four feet
tied together; here they were plumped down in a row close to
the place where the rites were to be held.</p>

<p>On the hearth, below the row of human skulls hanging opposite
the Chief’s door, there must now be started New Fire,—that
is, fire produced by the fire-saw, the most primitive method of
obtaining it, and, possibly, because it is the most primitive, it is
obligatory at all august ceremonies. According to tradition
among the Kayans and Kenyahs, one of the early inhabitants of
the earth, named Laki Oi, the Prometheus of Kayan mythology,
taught the people this method, and called it ‘Musa;’ he also
invented the fire-drill, which he called ‘Nalika.’ The Musa
consists of a piece of soft fibrous wood, which is held down
by the feet, firmly on the ground, and rests upon a bundle of fine
slivers of dry wood; underneath it, is passed a strip of dry but
flexible bamboo, which is sawed back and forth until the friction
starts a spark in the fine dust which has been thereby rubbed up;
the spark is fostered and soon blown into a flame in the bundle
of slivers. When the materials are in proper condition, fire can
be produced in much less than a minute. Should all the fires in
a house go out, or when fire is to be started for the first time in
a new house, the Musa is the only method whereby fire may be
kindled,—no flint and steel, nor fire-drill, nor fire-syringe, nor
matches, (common enough, thanks to the Chinese bazaar,) can be
used; it must be the Musa, and the Musa alone. At the naming
of a child, the piece of soft wood is carved into a grotesque head
at one end. The image thus made is called ‘Laki Pesong,’ the
god of the Musa.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp30" id="extra-illus-1" style="max-width: 12.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>The Stick, ‘Laki Pesong,’ and Strips of bamboo used in making New Fire.

</figure>

<p>But to return to Tama Bulan’s house. As soon as New Fire
had been kindled, the gongs, as on the day before, began their
deafening clangour; the parents, looking very grave, slowly
emerged from their ‘Lamin,’ or <i>private room</i>. The mother carried
the baby, who, for a wonder, was not crying,—but I could
see by his expression that he was well primed for a vigorous
bawl on the slightest provocation. Solemnly they marched and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
took their places on the large mat close to the hearth. Some
strong youths now seized the big black pig, Tama Bulan’s prime
selection, and partly lifting it, and partly swinging it about by the
ears and tail, not without squealings which would have been
ear-piercing but for the gongs, they hauled it up close beside the
Chief. Across the swine’s body and over its neck were wreathed
the mother’s most prized and costly strings of beads; according
to Kenyah computation, the value of these beads amounted to
the price of several slaves, or probably to the cost of two whole
houses. I suppose that this was not merely for the sake of
decorating the victim, but was designed to flatter and cajole it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
into having a beautiful liver, overspread with bright omens for
her boy.</p>

</figure>

<p>The relatives and the guests disposed themselves in a large
circle around the solemn parents, the infant, and the pig;
directly in front, and facing them, the Dayong sat cross-legged,
a very tall and skinny old man, whose lower jaw was furnished
with but one tooth, which, when he omitted to suck it in, stuck
out at right angles. He did not wear, as far as I could see, any
peculiar costume or badge of office; he was clad in nothing but
an ordinary loin-cloth.</p>

<p>When the assemblage had settled themselves in their places,
some sitting on the floor, others standing on the large rice mortars
so that they could look into the centre of the circle, the old
Dayong arose, and grasping in his right hand a parang and a
stick, the latter cut into a brush of splinters at one end, with his
left hand he sprinkled water upon them from a bowl held by an
assistant. The dripping stick and the parang he waved over the
child’s head and muttered words, which Tama Talun, again my
kind interpreter, said expressed the desire that the life of the
child might be as ‘laram,’ <i>cool</i>, as the water he was sprinkling
over it.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>To insure protection to the child against evil Spirits, a young
chicken was waved above and around it, as on the previous
day; and then at once the chicken’s head was chopped off and
some of its blood smeared on the baby’s hand. This indignity
supplied the provocation, which, from the first, I had anticipated,
and instantly stirred up all the depravity of the infant, who had
been thus far just as quiet as a lamb; the gongs now stopped
their din, but the bonnie babe proved an excellent substitute, and
awoke every echo in the smoky rafters overhead. He kicked,
and roared, and wriggled in his mother’s lap, bent himself backward,
and beat with his little fists at the fluttering chicken every
time it was waved near his face; I was really afraid he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
burst a blood-vessel so scarlet did his little body become with the
exertion of expelling those piercing shrieks; not a tear issued
from his eyes, and the bunches of pewter rings in his stringy
little ears kept flapping against his cheeks as he shook his head
and thrashed about in violent contortions. He never once
stopped bawling throughout all the rest of the ceremony.</p>

<p>All evil Spirits having been now effectually dispelled, the
Dayong squatted down by the pig, and taking from the fire a
small stick of wood with a glowing end he touched it to the pig’s
side, by way of calling the poor beast’s attention to what he was
about to say. When the pig’s struggles had calmed down, the
old man laid his hands on its side and soothingly addressed it as
‘Balli Boin Akán, Balli Boin Akán,’ and begged it to intercede
with Penylong and Perbungan, and to tell unerringly whether or
not the name now about to be given to the child had been auspiciously
chosen. The name had never yet been divulged; even the
old Dayong knew not what it was. It was an absolute secret
between Tama Bulan and the mother of the child. Some days
before, not knowing that the name was thus sacredly secret, I
had asked what it was to be, but Tama Bulan courteously told
me that it was utterly impossible for him to reveal it. All
through this ceremony, Tama Bulan sat cross-legged beside his
wife quietly, every feature wearing a very serious expression,
keenly watching the Dayong.</p>

<p>Most of the time, the mother sat with her legs straight out in
front of her, and with her squirming baby wriggling on her knees
from side to side; she kept her eyes cast down, watching the
child, but never attempting to stop its bawling, to which, indeed,
no one seemed to pay the slightest attention.</p>

<p>Little Adom had a view better, of course, than any body
except the principals; there he was lying flat on his face on a
beam directly above the naming-party, his legs and arms dangling
down on either side. When I caught sight of him his little,
black eyes danced with mischief, and from his lofty perch he
defied us with that impudent gesture which, in an unhappy
hour, I had taught him: putting his thumb to his nose, twirling
his fingers, and winking and blinking his eyes and lolling his
tongue out like a veritable little goblin. All the solemnity in the
world could never impress him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>When the Dayong had finished his address to the pig, italicising
important words by prods in the ribs with a bony thumb, he
took up a strip of bamboo, such as is used for the fire-saw, and,
bending it into a loop so that the two ends just touched, he set
fire to it at the bend and allowed it to burn through. The burning
of this loop was watched with breathless interest by Tama
Bulan, as well as by a group of old crones who had now
gathered close about the Dayong. When the loop snapped
asunder and the flame went out, the Dayong put the two strips
side by side and so rested the unburnt ends on his thumb-nail
as to make them exactly even, and then closely scrutinized the
burnt ends. He said not a word, but ominously shook his head,
assumed a troubled expression, and even forgot to suck in his
solitary tooth. The two strips were taken from him by one
of the old women and subjected to the same measurement and
scrutiny, except that she kept up a constant argument, and a
shaking of her head; finally, she fumbled over the burnt ends
and knocked off a little particle of ash just ready to fall; then
she held them up before the Dayong, and the tone of what she
uttered was decidedly more reassuring. He measured them
again very closely, and seemed to be better pleased. Tama Bulan
could restrain himself no longer, but got up hastily to examine
the strips for himself; he also rubbed with his finger one of the
charred ends, and then adjusted the sound ends on his thumb-nail,
but he shook his head, and said, somewhat despairingly,
‘I’m afraid one is much too long.’ Hereupon, the ever kind
Tama Talun explained to us that by these strips it is decided
whether or not the undivulged name which had been chosen is
a good one; if the two pieces are of exactly the same length,
the omen is unfavorable; if they are very unequal in length,
the name is likewise ill-chosen. There should be just the
tiniest, slightest difference in the length of the strips; then it is
absolutely certain that the name is well-chosen. (Ah! what a
shrewd, clever head devised this augury! how easy by this rule
of thumb-nail to make the difference slight, and how hard to
make the strips exactly even or greatly uneven!) So it happened
that, after the strips had passed over the thumb-nails of half a
dozen of the wisest crones and toothless old men, they were
returned to the Dayong, who was now fully convinced that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
first measurements had been entirely wrong, and he now emphatically
declared that the omens were most auspicious. Throughout
this momentous discussion the object of it all kept up an
unintermitting bawl; if the evil Spirits have ears, never during
this hour would they have molested him; there was no need
of gongs with that baby to the fore.</p>

<p>The charred ends of the bamboo strips were then dipped in a
cocoanut shell of water held by one of the old women standing
near; the ash and water were mixed by the Dayong into a paste
between his thumb and finger and smeared on the baby’s forehead
and in its hair. At the instant of doing this he leaned forward
and asked Tama Bulan what name he had selected. Tama
Bulan whispered mysteriously very low close to the Dayong’s
ear. The Dayong then reached for the cocoanut shell of water
held by the old woman, and most carefully and solemnly
advanced it toward the child; the shell was nervously followed
every inch of the way by four or five pairs of brown claw-like,
old hands with anxious zeal, lest a drop of its precious contents
should be spilled; in spite of the risk it ran from this excess of
zeal, it got to its destination safely, and the very instant that the
water was poured over the head of the baby the Dayong said aloud,
impressively, ‘Be thy name Lijow!’ The name, for the first time
thus uttered aloud, was murmured throughout the large assemblage,
and the happiness of the selection commended with ‘nods
and becks and wreathed smiles;’ it was the name of one of
Tama Bulan’s ancestors, and means <i>Tiger</i>. (It is unlucky to
name a child after a living person,—it is apt to make the child
stupid; and it is fatal to select the name of one who has recently
died,—speedy death follows.)</p>

<p>The cocoanut shell was now refilled with home-made arrack,
whereof a drop was placed on little Lijow’s lips from the finger
of the Dayong; then the mother, henceforth Tina Lijow, took
a sip from it, and Tama Bulan drained it to the dregs, whereof I
imagine there were plenty, due to the Dayong’s grimy finger.
Then the Dayong poured out a measure for himself, and then
we, as guests of importance, were courteously served, and after
us followed all the rest of the guests in turn. Again, as on the
first day, packages of salt, ginger-root, and bananas were passed
around, and The Ceremony was over. Everything had gone off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
to perfection, not an evil omen had marred its smooth success,—thanks
to the gongs and the strength of dear little Lijow’s
lungs; if his voice keeps its promise until manhood, he will
make himself heard throughout Sarawak.</p>

<p>It now only remained to wrap up the precious strips of bamboo
in a piece of banana leaf and place them in the bamboo
joint along with the symbols of the first day’s rites. After this
was properly accomplished, the ‘Balli Boin,’ that sacred pig, was
killed, and his considerate liver politely proclaimed in its every
tint that Lijow’s life would be all that the heart of a devoted
Kenyah parent could desire.</p>

<p>Tama Bulan, with a beaming face, said to us, ‘Don’t forget
to tell Tuan Hote [Hose] that I have called my boy Lijow; he
wanted to know what the name was to be, but I couldn’t tell
him then.’</p>

<p>The naming of little Lijow having been thus most successfully
finished, the Chief’s family party moved out of the circle
gathered about the hearth, and another family party took its
place in front of the Dayong; their Balli Boin was hoisted and
pulled into position, and the same ceremonies with the taking of
omens were punctiliously repeated. Of course, for these people
of lesser rank, there was not felt the same widespread interest
as for the Chief’s son, and, therefore, the assemblage gradually
dwindled; the cool river offered more attractions than the hot,
breezeless veranda, with its din of gongs and of squalling babies
and of squealing pigs, and its loud-voiced Dayong with an
unruly, projecting tooth. I think there were in all six babies
named on that day, and by the time the last had been proclaimed
a member of the clan the afternoon was well advanced.</p>

<p>Many a jar of arrack had been broached during the ceremonies,
consequently all the members of the household and their
guests were decidedly fain to sing and dance. The raised portion
of the flooring extending along the greater part of the veranda
under the eaves was lined with men waiting in turn for the cups
of arrack that were freely passed from lip to lip. Tama Bulan
beamed upon his whole large household, and with his own hands
dipped out the mild drink from the large jars with a ladle made
from a seed of the Billian tree (iron-wood). The minor notes of
Kaluris now resounded, and here and there on the floor of huge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
broad planks, for which Tama Bulan’s house is famous, the horny
feet of dancers thumped and shuffled and scraped as one after
another essayed to outdo all predecessors in the wild movements
of a war-dance. They leaped in the air, waving their parang and
shield; they stamped in time to the music; they whirled and
twisted, sometimes falling on one knee, slashing at imaginary
foes; the long feathers of the Argus pheasant waved from their
war-caps, and the black and white feathers of the horn-bill rattled
on their war-coats and glittered in the crimson level rays of the
sun that swept in under the eaves of the house. Now was the
time to bring forth the great horn-bill with its plumage of
cigarettes; it was tenderly moved to a beam within easy reach,
and its bristling feathers, which had cost so much fair labor,
were greedily snatched off, and in a trice the atmosphere of the
veranda, thick with tobacco-smoke, became even to the long
rays of the setting sun almost impenetrable.</p>

<p>While this smoking was literally in full blast, the women
retired to their rooms and arrayed themselves in every bit and
shred that they possessed of gaudy bead-work, for their necks,
their ears, and their waists; they donned their brightest fillets for
the hair, and they tied round their waists their skirts of black
cloth with patches of bright calico stitched down the side.
Down to their waists, except for these bead necklaces, they were,
as usual, bare.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the women was a signal to the men to
range themselves in two long rows facing each other; thus they
sat on the floor, puffing hard at their cigarettes and chuckling
with one another in anticipation of the ordeal they were about to
undergo. From one of the rooms the women issued in single
file; she who headed the procession carried a large bowl, the
next carried a cocoanut-shell spoon, the third bore a large flat
dish piled high with cubes of raw fat pork, behind her, fourth in
the line, followed Bulan, the daughter of the house, who carried
nothing; but everyone could see, by the twinkle of her eye, that
she meant mischief; this same order:—bowl-bearer, spoon-bearer,
pork-bearer, helper, was preserved in a regular series all down
the whole line of sixty or more women.</p>

<p>Sedately and slowly and silently they marched the whole
length of the veranda close to the wall of the apartments, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
then turned in between the lines of squatting men. When the
first man was reached, the procession halted, and from the bowl
held by the first woman, the spoon-bearer dipped a spoonful of
a muddy-looking liquid and poured it into the man’s gaping
mouth. As it touched his tongue, his face was a study in contortions;
when the spoon was withdrawn he tried first to smile,
then his eyes were lost in wrinkles, his mouth puckered up, he
looked seasick, and then with a shudder that shook his frame,
gulped down his dose; the spoon-bearer passed on, then the
bearer of the pork cubes halted in front of him, and Bulan,
taking from the dish one of those nauseating gray, greasy, tepid
cubes of raw fat, popped it dexterously into his mouth and then
wiped her greasy fingers across his upturned face. Again shuddering
tremors shook his frame, but—he bolted it! then gazed
about him with a sickly smile. Down both lines there burst forth
peals on peals of laughter; the men shouted and stamped their
feet with merriment over the victim’s misery, unmindful that his
fate would soon be theirs. The women tried hard to maintain
their gravity, but the varied and ludicrous sufferings of their
lords and masters were often too much for their dignity, and they
unreservedly joined in the mirth; to those against whom they
had any private grudge they administered an extra dose, or
stirred up the dregs of the drink, or bestowed a particularly
flabby and repulsive piece of pork. As we sat about half way
down the line, we had quite a while to await our turn, and to
speculate on the ingredients of the awful drink,—it was almost
adequately nauseating that we should have to take it out of that
family, that tribal spoon. My turn came at last. Well, it was a
ghastly dose and no mistake. It was lukewarm, it was fiery hot
with peppers, it was salt, it was pungent, it was sweet, it was flat,
it was sour, and it tasted strongly of brass bowl. All this was
administered from a spoon that without washing or wiping had
been already in the mouths of thirty or forty black-toothed
predecessors. Our uncontrollable and immeasurable disgust
created infinite amusement and prolonged laughter, and when
Bulan, full of mischievous merriment, followed with the pork
cubes, knowing that she had the Tuans at her mercy, she did
not leave the fraction of an inch of our faces that was not
bedaubed with grease. And then how she laughed! As though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
one such dose was not enough, there was the prospect before us
of having it, Heaven save the mark! again and again administered
down to the very last woman of that long, interminable procession;
first a spoonful of that appalling, unnameable liquid! then a
mouthful of raw pork! The devoted Tama Bulan and Tama
Talun came at length to our rescue, and told us that after the
first two or three doses there would be no offence if we just
dipped our finger in the drink and touched it to our tongue, and
if we merely took the pork between our lips; sometimes this
evasion was successful, but now and then the drink was forced
upon us, and we got a worse smearing from greasy fingers.
Shrewd old Laki La, profiting by experience at other similar
feasts, held a tumbler under his chin, and as fast as the drink and
pork were deposited in his mouth they were re-deposited in the
tumbler. Tama Usong, to whose house on the Apoh River we
had paid a visit only a little while before, sat next to me, and I
asked him how he was getting along, and if his stomach was not
nearly full. ‘Oh, no, indeed, Tuan,’ said he, laughing; ‘I long
ago put my stomach out here,’ and he pointed behind him to a
row, a foot long, of cubes of pork which he had surreptitiously
deposited on the railing of the veranda. It was a hideous nightmare!
But at last the little girls brought up the end of the
procession, and then the greater part of the assembly dashed for
the river to wash off a little of the fat with which their faces
were fairly dripping.</p>

<p>Tama Talun explained to us that this was a survival of old
times, when warriors returned from a head-hunt, and sat thus
and were obliged to take in their mouths a small piece of their
enemy’s flesh, served to them just as the fat pork is served now-a-days.
They were not to swallow the human flesh, but merely
hold it between their lips to show contempt for the enemy, and
also thereby to absorb his valour. Dr. Hose, when told of this
interpretation, asserted that the object of this ceremony is to
impress evil Spirits, who, when they see so many men with faces
smeared with food, will be led to think that a very great feast had
taken place in honor of the newly named children, and that, therefore,
these children must be most important people, and to harm
them would stir the anger of a vast multitude. Dr. Hose’s
knowledge of the Kenyahs extends over so many years that it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
venturesome to dissent from him; nevertheless, our interpretation
was received directly from an unusually intelligent native, while
the ceremony was going on before us, and was, moreover, given
voluntarily without any questions on our part. Dr. Hose rejects
this interpretation, because of his conviction that cannibalism, in
any form whatsoever, never existed in Borneo.</p>

</figure>

<p>By the time we had returned to our places in the veranda,
after having washed off in the river the abhorred grease from our
faces, the women had doffed their uncomfortable burdens of
finery and were squatting among the men, in a close group round
Tama Bulan, who was cutting the rattan bindings of several
more large jars of arrack. The Chief was the first to quaff the
beverage, and as he lifted the cup to his lips the whole assemblage
began to intone a continuous ‘oo-oo-oo-oo,’ in harmony but with
a deep bass predominant, and kept up this resonant accompaniment
until the last drop was drained. After Tama Bulan, the
guests were served in turn, and as each one lifted the cup to
his lips (and it must be drained to the last drop at one draught)
this ‘oo-oo’-ing rose and fell like a bewildering, deafening humming
in the ears; it was to me a noteworthy experience; unquestionably
it marvellously accelerates the action of the alcohol in
the arrack. When the cup had been passed round several times
to each man and woman, and the oo-oo-ing was becoming somewhat
discordant and boisterous, the door of one of the rooms was
flung open and the genuine feast was brought in, piled high in
three small canoes borne on the shoulders of men staggering under
the weight. One-half of each canoe was heaped with little packages
of boiled rice wrapped in green banana leaves and tied with
pieces of grass; the other half fairly bristled, like a fretful porcupine,
with bamboo skewers whereon were several bits of boiled
pork. (It will, perhaps, be noted that a feast does not consist in
variety or quality, but in quantity.) Here and there among the
guests were placed bowls of salted fish pulverised, and to each
guest were given a packet of rice and a stickful of meat, while
Tama Bulan shouted the hospitable injunction, ‘Kuman plahei
plahei’—<i>Eat slowly, slowly!</i> There was no stint; everyone
was freely at liberty to have as many portions of rice and of
meat as he could eat, and was welcome to help himself to all
he wished of the dried fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>In my packet of rice there was a little discoloration at one
end, that looked like iron rust, but Ma Obat, a one-eyed and
villainous-looking old fellow, who sat beside me, seeing that I
scrutinized the spot rather carefully, politely took the lump of
rice out of my hand, and with a thumb-nail that looked, I must
say, like a coal-heaver’s shovel, scraped away the dubious portion
and then handed the lump back to me. The discolored grains
were gone, but, woe’s me, they were replaced by several grimy
finger-marks. For the sake of his triumphant and kindly beaming
smile I could not refuse to eat it, and so with eyes fixed on
the rafters overhead,—it was bolted!</p>

<p>This feast marked the conclusion of the ceremonies, and we
stuffed and smoked, and then as darkness was beginning to fall,
Dr. Hiller and I, with several of the young men, strolled down
the veranda to pay respectful visits in the family rooms. In
Mujan’s room, I am sorry to say, we found both Mujan and
her elder sister in a state of—well, intoxication; the arrack and
the oo-oo-ing had been too much for them. Ordinarily, they
were quiet, demure girls, the belles of the veranda, and industrious
workers at rice-pounding. But such lapses are, according
to Kenyah morality, by no means unpardonable, nay, at
such a high tide and festival as the present, were to be rather
applauded as a great and ladylike compliment to the host. Mujan
and her sister were sitting with their backs against the partition;
the head of the elder reclined on the shoulder of the younger,
and, though awake, she gave, from time to time, a sighing snore.
Mujan, the younger, was trying to entertain a group of visitors,
and her fingers were crumpling cigarette wrappers and tobacco
in a futile attempt to make some cigarettes for her friends. All
she could murmur to us was,’Aku mabok, Tuan, Aku mabok’—<i>I’m
drunk, sirs, I’m drunk</i>. We stayed only a few minutes, joking
with her about her state, and then went with the others to
visit Sara, another fashionable belle, who, however, in our eyes,
was far from personally attractive; she had lost four of her upper
front teeth; their loss made her conversation anything but easy
to understand. When we arrived, Sara had retired to her
modicum of a sleeping-room, but she was persuaded to emerge,
and then she announced that the arrack had given her a severe
headache. Deng’s elder brother,—I forget his name,—at once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
volunteered to apply cups to her temple, and she acquiesced.
She provided the cupping instrument, which consisted of a small
cylinder of bamboo, sealed at one end with a lump of wax. The
operator, with a small knife, scratched four or five little wounds
on her temple, and then making a small hole through the lump
of wax on the bamboo cylinder he applied the open end to the
wound and proceeded to suck the air out of the cylinder with
his lips. When the air was sufficiently exhausted he closed the
hole in the wax with his teeth, and the bamboo remained adhering
to her temple, like a horn. She smiled, chatted, and never
once winced throughout the whole operation, and after about
half an ounce of blood had been drawn pronounced herself much
better.</p>

</figure>

<p>Just at this minute, Tama Bulan hurried into the room, and,
asking us to come out, excitedly told us that a woman, named
Lueng, whose child had been one of those to receive a name
that day, was very ill and had fallen down in her room suddenly,
and could not be wakened; had we ever heard of such
a thing, he asked, in our country, or had we by chance any
medicine for her. We went at once with him and found the
woman in a state of profound collapse; she had been suffering
from a severe attack of grippe, and the excitement of the day
had been too great for her; we could get no further history than
this, and from the cackling old women who were busy about her
and from her husband and her brother we could get no coherent
answers to our questions. We did the best we could with our
limited resources; we stimulated her heart with hypodermics of
strychnia; we had her laid flat instead of propped up, as she
had been by the old women; at length she revived sufficiently
to ask for water. When we bade them to give it to her they
positively refused, saying we wanted to poison her; by administering
a hypodermic injection we had indiscreetly overstepped the
bounds of Kenyah submission to the white man’s medicine.
Instead of water, the old women insisted on pouring down the
patient’s throat a thick, warm paste of rice and water, at which,
of course, she gagged and choked. We saw that our efforts
were of no avail, and were therefore compelled to resign her to
her friends and the Dayongs. One very officious old woman
seemed to think that the sovereign remedy for such ills was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
reach and scratch the patient’s back-bone by kneading the finger-tips
deep down into the abdomen. Indeed, at one time, I thought
she would actually push her fingers through the skin and tear the
vitals from the unconscious woman. We told Tama Bulan that
we could do nothing further, and that the woman would probably
die; whereupon, knowing the temper of his people, he urged us
to leave her to the Dayongs and to come away. Shortly after,
as we were sitting in the fading twilight in the little apartment
which Tama Bulan had caused to be put up for us, we saw them
bring the limp body out of the room and place it on a mat in
the veranda, only a few feet away from our door. The husband
and the brother were frantic with grief and anxiety, and continually
bent over her and shouted her name; then they took a
blow-pipe and, putting one end close to her ear, they shouted her
name again, hoping to call back her soul that was wandering off.
They told her that her little child was crying for her and wanted
to be fed. I crept into the group, once, and listened for her heart-beats,
but they had stopped for ever. Tama Bulan asked me,
aside, ‘Is she alive, Tuan?’ and when I told him she was dead,
he whispered, ‘Don’t tell them; let them discover it themselves.’</p>

<p>A female Dayong was then summoned to find out whither
the soul had gone, and to lure it back to the body; to this end
she made several successive demands of valuable beads from the
husband, as a fee, and the agonised, headlong haste with which
he ran to get them from time to time, was truly pathetic.</p>

<p>I have said elsewhere that I could detect among this people
no signs of genuine, unselfish affection. Perhaps this should be
qualified by saying that at the solemn hour of death, or of its
threatened approach, they manifest an emotion in which there
certainly seems to be an element of affection, but even then alarm
or terror seems to predominate.</p>

<p>A flickering damar lamp was placed on the floor near the
body, and within the circle of its light the old hag of a Dayong,
chanting in a monotonous minor key, strutted backward and forward
with a shield in one hand and a parang in the other, and
many strings of beads about her neck and waist. Twice she
paused to ask for a young chicken, and when it was handed to
her, she seized its head in her mouth and bit it off, sucked a
mouthful of blood from the neck and spat it on the floor, closely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
scrutinising how it had splattered. Throughout this scene the
grief-stricken, wailing reiteration of the dead woman’s name
echoed through the veranda, now but dimly lit with damar lamps;
every sound of mirth and gaiety was hushed; the only noise,
except the wailings and the Dayong, came from the dogs and
the pigs beneath the house, where they snarled and fought over
the remnants of the feast that had fallen through the floor.</p>

<p>When the female Dayong had done her utmost to recall the
soul, and had failed, our good, faithful friend, Tama Talun,
volunteered to try his power. He demanded no costly beads,
merely a parang, and in the same manner as his predecessor he
walked backward and forward in the circle of light. We could
not understand a word of what he was saying, but every now and
then he threw down his parang so that its point stuck in the floor,
where it remained swaying from side to side. As it swayed he
walked slowly, about ten paces from it, and then gave a hop in
the air and a shrill shout. Then slowly he walked back to the
parang, pulled it up, and continued his chanting and walking.</p>

<p>While this was going on, the group suddenly realised that
the woman was veritably dead, beyond all hope. With a scream
the husband and the brother snatched up the body and rushed
into the family room with it; some of the group followed, and
some crept silently away into the dark corners of the veranda.</p>

<p>Before long, Tama Bulan came to tell us that the people were
in a highly excited state, and, most unfortunately, they held us
responsible for the woman’s tragic and sudden death, and that
we had better remain in our little room and not venture out into
the veranda.</p>

<p>It was not the most pleasant situation imaginable. We were
well aware of the excitable nature and the undisciplined minds of
the people among whom we were; we knew that they passed in
an instant from extreme friendliness to a Berserker rage; and we
were but two against three hundred; our means of defence consisted
of only two revolvers. Grave as we knew the danger must
be, we very fortunately did not know until some time afterward,
from Tama Bulan, how extreme it was, and how difficult it had
been for him to save our lives.</p>

<p>After Tama Bulan had left us, we heard a pounding and chopping
against the partition wall of the room to which the body had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
been carried; several boards were removed, and an opening made
from it into the veranda; through this opening the corpse was
borne; it must not pass through a doorway used by the living.
The poor, inanimate body was decked out in all the gay garments
so recently worn at the feast, and, with a cigarette between the
fingers, it was laid partly recumbent on a bier that had been
quickly constructed, and draped with white cloth. On the bier
beside the corpse an old woman seated herself (all this we could
observe through the crevices of our room) and at once began a
wail for the dead. This lugubrious wailing was kept up, to my
certain knowledge, without intermission for two nights and a day.
Of course, there were constant relief parties.</p>

<p>During these two nights and a day we remained close prisoners
in our little room. Throughout the first long night Tama
Bulan proved himself inflexibly our staunch friend; he insisted
over and over again on our innocence, and pleaded for us with
the adherents of Lueng’s husband and brother, who were clamouring
for our heads as offerings to the dead woman and as
decorations for their homes. This thirst for our blood lasted
during our imprisonment, and was throughout restricted to the
husband and brother of Lueng and to their immediate friends.
They were all guests, who had come to the Naming.</p>

<p>When the wailing had been adequately performed the corpse
was placed in a coffin hewn from a large log and the cover sealed
down with raw gutta percha.</p>

<p>Our most friendly relations with Tama Bulan’s household had
not for a moment been broken. Nevertheless, the next day Tama
Bulan came to us and said that, in view of all the circumstances,
he thought it best that our visit should come to an end; and, inasmuch
as Laki La and his followers were going down the river,
we had better take advantage of the chance and accompany them.
Of course, we acquiesced. The object for which we had come
was accomplished. We had seen that which no white man had
ever before reported, namely, the noteworthy ceremonies of a
Naming, and we had passed six delightful weeks in the far interior
of Borneo, in intimate, friendly intercourse with men, whom <i>nous
autres</i> are pleased to term savages. So we fell to work, packed
up our things, distributed among our especial friends all that was
left of our stores of cloth and tobacco, made Tama Bulan’s eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
sparkle with delight over our present of silver dollars, bade good-bye
to his daughter Bulan, and his two wives, not forgetting a
chuck under the chin to little Lijow, and hastened down to the
boat. Our final parting with dear old Tama Bulan was almost
watery; and, as we swept out into the current, with our pith
helmets we waved a prolonged farewell to the row of flapping
palm-leaf hats which lined the long veranda.</p>

<p>Old Laki La was as affable as possible while he sat in our
canoe, and we even volunteered to draw for him the solitary tooth
remaining in his lower jaw. He waggled it with his tongue
pensively for a moment, and then remarked that as he should
not live much longer anyhow, he thought that it had better
die with him. We considered him a most pleasant old fellow,
until we reached his very large house on the Pata, not far below
Tama Bulan’s; but as soon as we touched his landing-place we
were undeceived; he disembarked without so much as turning
round to say good-bye, and behind him trooped all our paddlers,
whom we had expected to take us down at least as far as
Tama Lohong’s house on the Baram.</p>

<p>Here was a serious difficulty, and Laki La would pay absolutely
no attention to any appeal to him for men.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion that the man I mentioned in the first
paragraph of this chapter came forward most kindly, and offered
to get together some men to take us as far as Tama Lohong’s,
and all the way down to the Fort, if necessary; and so it fell
out. It made me blush to think of the ingratitude I showed in
forgetting his name, and I am still blushing; for even now,
cudgel my brains as I will, I cannot recall it.</p>

<p>One evening, an hour before sunset, at the time when in every
direction, the angular outlines of the huge fruit-bats, with bodies
as large as a cat, are silhouetted against the sky, as they make
an unswerving and majestic flight toward their nocturnal feeding-grounds,
we halted our dug-out canoes at the muddy sloping
bank in front of the house of Aban Avit, an influential Chief on
the Tinjar River.</p>

<p>We were uninvited, and, as far as we knew, unexpected, but
the host, upon whom we were thus unceremoniously forcing ourselves,
advanced to meet us, as we ascended the unsteady, plank
walk, raised on piles, leading to his house, and, with a warmth
unusual among an undemonstrative people, welcomed us with a
smile that revealed every one of his thirty-two coal-black teeth.
We were, to be sure, old friends, having stopped at his house on
our way up-river; but, as he had afterward heard that we were
going to make the ascent of Mount Dulit, where all varieties of
evil Spirits and dragons have their haunts, he said he had really
never expected to see us again; and had we not returned just
when we did, he, good soul, had planned to go with a party of
his bravest men in search of us; but here we were again safe and
sound, none the worse for the dreadful journey, and not one of
us marked with the scar of ‘Gum Toh,’ <i>a ghost’s-clutch</i>,—a
cutaneous tumor, to which these dark-skinned people are subject,
well known to us as a <i>Keloid of Addison</i>, but which the Borneans
aver is due to the clutch of a ghost’s hand. As soon as we were
within the veranda of the house, Aban Avit insisted that his own
private room should be resigned to us; accordingly, his manifold
possessions were moved to one side, and clean rattan mats spread
upon the floor; his fireplace, heaped with dry wood, was put at
the disposal of our Chinese cook, and several long bamboo
water-jars were brought from the river so that there should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
no delay in the preparation of our evening meal. Ah, the hospitality
of a head-hunter!</p>

</figure>

<p>When all our numerous boxes and bundles had been brought
up from the boats, we wandered inquisitively about the long-house,
asking endless questions of our host and of his brother; and, as
they both spoke Malay fluently, our conversation drifted into all
sorts of channels. Aban Avit is a widower, as the <i>Aban</i> in his
name declares, and Avit was the name of his wife. The Kayans,
and allied tribes, adopt names to suit the varying events of their
lives. Thus, a widower always takes his dead wife’s name prefixed
by Aban; a father bears the name of his first-born child
prefixed by Tama, or Ma, meaning <i>father</i>, as long as the child
lives; should the child die, Tama is changed to <i>Oyang</i>. For
instance, Tama Bulan means the <i>father of Bulan</i>. Oyang Batu
means he who is <i>bereft of his son Batu</i>. Bulan is a girl’s name,
meaning <i>Moon</i>; Batu is a boy’s name, and means <i>Stone</i>, equivalent
to our <i>Peter</i>. If Bulan, the daughter of Tama Bulan, should
have a son named Madang, Tama Bulan, whose original name
was Wang, would then adopt the grandfather’s title of <i>Laki</i>, and
be known as Laki Madang.</p>

<p>Our host [whose photograph is given on the opposite page]
was one of the best types of the inland tribes.</p>

<p>Throughout his house, on partition walls and on rafters, there
was scroll-work in black and white paint, the black lines evidently
made with a finger and the dots of white with a thumb.
On the wall of his private room, just above his sleeping-place,
were two much conventionalised and interlaced figures with arms
and legs like long tendrils. These figures, Aban Avit explained,
represented ‘Wawa’ monkeys (the <i>Gibbon Ape</i>), animals held
sacred by his family for certainly three generations, and never
killed by any member of the household; he regarded them as
his best of friends, and that day was sure to be lucky when they
crossed his path in the jungle, or when their musical, almost
bird-like, call was heard near the house.</p>

<p>This hereditary veneration of an animal suggests a trace
of totemism, otherwise rare in Borneo. Aban Avit, in telling
us about his veneration for the Wawa, cast down his eyes
and spoke in a voice so low we could hardly hear him, as
if the very breathing of a name so sacred were profanation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
He told us the painting was the work of his own
hands.</p>

<p>From this private apartment, which even at high noon was
dark, but as soon as the sun had set was verily as dark as the
proverbial pocket, we made our way to the veranda, where daylight
still lingered; here again we noticed our host’s love of decoration;
the rack whereon visitors as soon as they enter the
veranda, hang their parangs, instead of being a customary row
of pegs or merely crotched sticks, was a board, whereof the lower
edge, as it hung horizontally from the rafters, about half way up
the slant of the roof, had been carved by the Chief himself into
graceful double-headed hooks and loops, so that the belts
attached to the parangs could be easily hung on them and the
weapons would be out of the way, yet conveniently at hand.
It is an unequivocal insult for a guest to enter a friendly veranda
with his parang about his waist; etiquette demands that it be
unfastened before stepping into the house; it should be then laid
aside or hung on the rack while the owner is engaged in friendly
gossip. The house was new at the time of our visit, in fact, it
was not yet wholly finished; at the up-river end, five or six huge
piles had been planted for its further extension; these posts,
about fifteen feet out of the ground and eighteen inches in diameter,
were likewise carved, but with grotesque devil-faces, from
whose grinning mouths tusks like the wild boar’s protruded,
below them snakes, and spiral curves representing the recurved
protuberance on the beak and head of the Horn-bill,—the war-bird
of all the Kayan and Kenyah tribes. Here and there, of
course, conventionalised figures of the Wawa were to be detected.
It seems an inviolable rule with all Bornean decoration that the
representation of any living thing must be hinted at so grotesquely,
that it takes a subtle imagination to discern what it really represents;
possibly, this is due to the idea, so widely scattered
throughout the far East, that to make a life-like image of any
animal involves a risk of danger to the maker,—a danger which
may be vague or otherwise as chance may interpret it,—and of
which we see an intimation, possibly, in the second commandment
of the Decalogue.</p>

<p>When twilight suddenly deepened into night and blazing
brands were brought to replenish the fire on the hearth opposite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
the Chief’s door, we squatted round about it, not for warmth,
but for the cheer of its flicker, and because,—well, does a pipe
ever taste as good as when lit by an ember?</p>

<p>Aban Avit sat beside us, and while we were filling our pipes
he produced from the bamboo box, hanging at his side, some
tobacco and some of that beautifully delicate dried leaf of the
wild banana cut from the heart of the plant, before the leaf
is unfurled; in unskilled hands it tears like wet tissue-paper,
but in Aban Avit’s a tapering, symmetrical cigarette, eight
inches long, was skilfully rolled on his thigh. A circle of
small boys squatted around us, their bright, little eyes watching
our every movement as intently as we stare at the actions of
some strange animal in a Zoölogical Garden. If we struck a
match, or sneezed, or buttoned our coats, or wiped our faces with
a handkerchief, dilated eyes and open mouths attended the action
with wrapt interest. A few men sat near their Chief, and now
and then murmured comments to one another in their native
tongue, which we did not fully understand, but could guess from
the direction of their eyes, that we were the subject of their conversation.
The evening duties of the household were not, however,
interrupted on our account; men with bundles of dried fire-wood
on their shoulders, women staggering under a load of bamboo
joints filled with water, and stacked in hampers on their backs,
were constantly passing by us, treading heavily, and making the
loose boards of the floor clatter and rattle as they plodded their
weary way to their apartments. For a time there was almost
a constant succession of canoes coming to the landing-place,
bringing back the workers from the rice-clearings. The women
all bending under full hampers, some with fresh, uncurled fern-fronds,
and the sprouts of a variety of large Canna, which they
stew with rice to add variety to their diet; some with bundles
of the young banana leaf, whereof to make cigarette-wrappers,
and others with wild tapioca and wild yams. Each one carried
her own light paddle in one hand, and a large round and flat sun-hat
in the other. None of them glanced to right or left, but made
her way direct to her family room, and like a ghost faded into
the darkness through the small doorway. After them followed
the men, dangling their parangs in one hand and trailing their
blow-pipes and spears in the other. They, too, looked fixedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
ahead, until they had hung up their parang and stuck their spear
perpendicularly into a rafter so that the shaft should be kept
straight; this done, they joined the group round the fire, or
went down to the river to bathe. At the far end of the house
some young fellows were playing mournful tunes on a Kaluri,
and its organ-like notes were wafted fitfully down to us; now
and then a baby’s wail chimed in, and then was quieted by the
mother’s crooning lullaby. Beneath the house, the contented
grunting of pigs and the clucking of chickens denoted that these
omen-givers had returned from their foraging in the jungle, and
had sought the shelter of home for the night.</p>

</figure>

<p>Thus we sat as twilight faded in Aban Avit’s veranda,—in the
home of these people, whereof every detail made up their familiar,
common-place life, the only life from cradle to grave that they
had ever known or would know, while we by their side were
aliens from a world twelve thousand miles away, from a country
that they had never heard of, and of a race which many of them
had never seen before. We were in the very heart of the Bornean
jungle, guests, in the house of a barbarous ‘savage’ and bloodthirsty
‘head-hunter,’—but, these terms, when applied at that
moment to our host, what misnomers! Could contrast be more
emphatic than the perfect peacefulness of our surroundings,
and the thought that a man as benignant and hospitable as
Aban Avit should cherish as his highest aim in life to add every
year to that cluster of human heads hanging from the rafters
just above us, and gently swaying in the heat ascending from
the flames? Is it conceivable that this gentle-hearted man, and
his circle of good-humored friends, could take pride and pleasure
in recognising and rehearsing the slashes and gashes borne by
each head? The long gash there, on the left side of that skull,
showing through the piece of old casting-net, was made by
Tama Lohong’s parang, the very one with carved wooden handle
that he carries to this day. The owner of the next skull was
fishing when he fell a victim to a stealthy thrust from Apoi’s
spear. This small one is that of a young girl who tried to escape
from the rear of a house when they burned out those Madangs,
way over near the Rejang River. Thus they can enumerate
them all, chief and slave, man, woman, girl, and boy. It all
seemed so at variance with Aban Avit’s genial, courteous hospitality,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
that I wondered if it were possible to look at these
skulls through his eyes, and to sympathise with his thrill
of pride and exultation in them. I waited until Aban Avit
had his cigarette fairly rolled and lit, and then, trying not to
appear in the least antagonistic, lest I should fail to elicit his
genuine feelings, I asked, ‘O Sabilah, [Blood-brother] why is it
that all you people of Kalamantan kill each other and hang up
these heads? In the land I come from such a thing is never
known; I fear that it would be ill-spoken of there, indeed
perhaps, thought quite horrible. What does Aban Avit think
of it?’ He turned to me in utter, absolute surprise, at first with
eyes half-closed, as doubting that he heard aright, and letting the
smoke curl slowly out of his mouth for a moment, he then replied,
with unwonted vehemence:—‘No, Tuan! No! the custom is
not horrible. It is an ancient custom, a good, beneficent custom,
bequeathed to us by our fathers and our fathers’ fathers; it brings
us blessings, plentiful harvests, and keeps off sickness, and pains.
Those who were once our enemies, hereby become our guardians,
our friends, our benefactors.’ ‘But,’ I interrupted, ‘how does
Aban Avit know that these dried heads do all this? Don’t
you make it an excuse just because you like to shed blood and
to kill?’ ‘Ah, Tuan, you white men had no great Chief, like
Tokong, to show you what was right; haven’t you ever heard the
story of Tokong and his people? He was Rajah of the Sibops
and the father of all the Kayans, and lived long, long, long ago.’
I was not acquainted with the story of Tokong, so I begged him
to relate it; then, squatting on the floor with his forearms lightly
resting on his knees, and his hands dangling in front of him, he
meditatively relit his cigarette, and, gazing lovingly up at the
cluster of skulls, began:—</p>

<p>‘It was in the old, old days, long before the Government came
here, (by the Government, I mean our Tuan Rajah Brooke,) it
happened that on a time the descendant of the heaven-born
Katirah Murai, Tokong, and his men of the Sibop tribe were on
an expedition down-river to punish a household of thieves who
had stolen their crop of rice the year before, and had chased
Tokong’s women and children from the jungle-clearings. It
was the time of year when the fields had just been planted, and
before the rice had sprouted; so Tokong took out his warriors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
to teach these thieves that this year there should be no more
stealing. When they had gone down-river to the great bamboo
clump where they had to cross through the jungle, they drew their
canoes up to the bank, and, with Tokong leading, started on their
stealthy march. When the eye of day looked straight down at
them over their heads, they rested on the bank of a small stream
which ran round that great rock, (perhaps, Tuan, you have seen
it,)—we call it “Batu Kusieng,”—near the head-waters of the
Belaga and Tinjar Rivers. They had cooked, and eaten, and
had drawn out the pegs of wood whereon their rice-pots rested,
and Rajah Tokong was slipping his head through his war-coat
and girding on his parang, when he heard, coming from under
the great rock, a squeaking, croaking voice, uttering, “Wong
kokók teta Batók.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He paused, and, turning round to listen to
the voice, saw a large frog with its young ones about it sitting
just under the edge of the rock. “Greetings to you, Kop,” [Frog]
said the Rajah. “What is the meaning of your croaking?” and Kop
replied, “Alas, what fools you Sibops are! You go out to battle
and kill men, but you take back with you to ornament your
shields only their hair; whereas, did you but know it, if you took
the whole head you would have blessings beyond words. Insooth,
you heavy-livered people know not how to take a head.
Look here, and I’ll show you.” Thus spoke Kop, and straightway
seized one of his little ones, and with one stroke of his
parang cut off its head. Tokong was exceedingly angry at the
impudence and the cruelty of the frog, and, paying no further
attention to it, ordered his men to advance at once. But some of
the older men among them could not help thinking that perhaps
Kop spoke the truth, and that night, while they sat round the
fire, holding a council of war over the attack on the enemy’s
house, close at hand, they urged Tokong to allow them to follow
the frog’s advice. At first, Tokong, still very angry because
Kop had called the Sibops “fools” and “heavy-livered,” refused;
but finally, seeing that many of his best men were in favor of it,
he granted their request. Next morning, when the sky began
to turn gray and the birds in the trees were just waking up,
the Sibops noiselessly carried armfuls of bark and grass,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
and placed them beneath the thieves’ house, and set fire to them,
and the flames ran quickly everywhere. Out rushed the men
and women, some jumping into the flames, others trying to slide
down the house-posts; but all were met with slashes and stabs
from the swords and spears of Tokong’s men. Many were killed
that day, and the heads of three were cut off and carried away
by Tokong’s party, who retreated at once, and, almost before they
knew it, were at the landing-place on the river. To their great
amazement, they found their boats all ready and launched! No
sooner were they seated than the boats began to move off, of their
own accord, right up-stream in the direction of home. It was a
miracle! The current of the stream changed and ran up hill, as
it does at flood-tide at the mouth of a river. They almost immediately
reached the landing-place close to their house, and were
overjoyed to see that the crops planted only fifteen days before
had not only sprouted, but had grown, had ripened, and were
almost ready for the harvest. In great astonishment they hurried
through the clearings, and up to their house. There, they found
still greater wonders! those who were ill when the party set out
were now well, the lame walked and the blind saw! Rajah
Tokong and all his people were convinced on the spot that it was
because they had followed Kop’s advice, and they vowed a vow
that ever afterward the heads of their enemies should be cut off
and hung up in their houses. This is the story of Rajah Tokong,
Tuan. We all follow his good example. These heads above us
have brought me all the blessings I have ever had; I would not
have them taken from my home for all the silver in the country.’</p>

<p>He turned to appeal to his people sitting near, and they, as
many as understood Malay, nodded their heads, glancing from
him to us, and murmuring ‘Betúl, betúl!’ [’Tis true, ’tis true]
He paused to get an ember out of the glowing heap of ashes to
light his cigarette again, which had become much crumpled
during the narration of Rajah Tokong’s first head-hunt, and after
he had it once more in shape, I asked him if he would not regard
it as somewhat of an inconvenience if his own head were to be
cut off, just to bring blessings to an enemy’s house. ‘Tuan,’
he replied, ‘I do not want to become dead any more than I want
to move from where I am; if my head were cut off, my second
self would go to Bulun Matai, [the Fields of the Dead,] where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
beyond a doubt I should be happy; the Dayongs tell us, and
surely they know, that those who have been brave and have
taken heads, as I have, will be respected in that other world
and will have plenty of riches. When I die my friends will beat
the gongs loud and shout out my name, so that those who
are already in Bulun Matai, will know that I am coming, and
meet me when I cross over the stream on Bintang Sikópa [the
great log.] I shall be glad enough to see them. But I don’t want
to go to-day, nor to-morrow.’ His faith seemed immovable, but I
could not resist the temptation of suggesting a doubt, so I asked
him what if the Dayongs were wrong, and there were no Bulun
Matai, and that when he stopped breathing he really died and
knew no more. He answered me almost with scorn for such a
doubt. ‘Tuan, nothing really dies, it changes from one thing
to another. The Dayongs must be right, for they have been to
the Fields of the Dead and come back to tell us all about it.’
‘Don’t you feel sorry,’ I asked, ‘for those that you kill? It
hurts badly to be cut by a parang; you don’t like it, and those
whom you cut down dislike it as much as you do; they are
no more anxious to go to Apo Leggan or Long Julán [Regions
in Bulun Matai] than you are.’ ‘Ah, Tuan,’ he replied, with
the suggestion of a patronizing chuckle in his voice, ‘you feel
just as I did, when I was a little boy and had never seen
blood. But I outgrew such feelings, as every one should. My
father, a very great warrior, and known and feared by the people
of many, many rivers, wanted his sons to be as brave and fearless
as he was himself. So one day he dragged out into the
jungle old Bállo Lahíng, [widow of Lahíng,] and tied her fast
to a tree by rattans on her wrists and ankles. She was a slave-woman,
captured when she was a young girl, by his grandfather
over in the Batang Kayan country, and, at the time I speak of,
she was very old, and weak, and very thin, and couldn’t do any
work because she was nearly blind. My father told my brother
yonder and me, and one or two other boys, all of us, little fellows
then, (I remember, my ears were still sore from having these
holes for tiger-cat’s teeth cut in them,) well,—he told us we must
go out with spears and learn to stick them in something alive,
and not to be afraid to see blood, nor to hear screams,—then
I felt just as you do. Besides, I was really very fond of old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Bállo Lahíng; she it was who tied on my first chawat [waist-cloth]
for me, I remembered it well, for she laughed a great deal
at me, and then I saw how few teeth she had, and she often used
to sing me to sleep with that song about “Tama Poyong with a
twisted leg.” I couldn’t bear the thought of hurting her, and
sending her away off to Long Julán, so I flatly refused to take
a spear with me. But my father said I must; there was no harm
in it; that it was right, and I must take one; he pulled me by
the arm, and I had to follow. Then I was afraid she might see
me, so I sneaked round behind the tree and just pricked her with
the point of the iron, then she guessed what my father had tied her
there for, and screamed as loud as she could, “Oh, don’t! Oh,
don’t! Oh, don’t!” over and over again, and very fast; I pricked
her a little harder the next time to hear what she would say, but she
only kept on shrieking the same words. Then one of the other
boys, smaller even than I, ran his spear right through her thigh,
like this, and the old people laughed and said that was good; and
the blood ran down all over the wrinkles on her knees; and then
I wanted to make it run just in the same way, so I pushed and
pushed my spear hard into her; and after that, I never thought
whether it was Bállo Lahíng or not, I just watched the blood;
and we all ran round her piercing her here and piercing there
until she sank right down on the ground with her hands in the
rattan loops above her head, which tumbled over to one side,
and no more blood came out of her. Then my father praised us
all loudly, and me in particular, and said we had been good
boys and had done well! How could I feel at all sorry then for
the old thing? I thought only that I had obeyed my father and
that I was a great warrior and could wear horn-bill’s feathers,
and tiger-cat’s teeth. That’s the way to become a Man; a baby
is afraid of blood, Tuan. My father was right. No man can be
brave who doesn’t love to see his spear draw blood.’</p>

<p>I responded with many nods, drew furiously at my pipe, and
fell silent. Aban Avit believed that he had made a convert.</p>

<p>Aban Avit’s faith in a future life was invincible, and thoroughly
characteristic of the Oriental mind, which accepts that faith
with an assurance which should put to the blush an Occidental
Agnostic. To be sure, to attain the Oriental Paradise does not
depend upon the adherence in this life to that morality which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
distinguishes good and bad actions. It is noteworthy, that in
several of these Oriental languages there is no word to express
‘sin.’ A cruel and vindictive man is to be shunned merely
because his actions are disagreeable or inconvenient to those
about him. But when he dies, and can then cause no more
trouble, his memory is as cherished as a Saint’s, and those who
knew him will give him the customary amount of profuse wailing,
and believe that his spirit passes as surely to the same
‘heaven’ as the kindest and gentlest of them all.</p>

<p>How greatly the faith of the Borneans in eternal life is indebted
to their surroundings can be realized perhaps only by one who
has lived in that boundless jungle, where, on every hand, Nature
is in her wildest, most exuberant, most lavish mood; where
life dies and is renewed in an hour. Is it any wonder that the
Jungle people, with this eternal loss and eternal gain ever present,
think no more of cutting down a human fellow-creature than
of chopping down a tree or of plucking a gaudy flower? The
jungle is an ever-present ocular proof that life follows life. Here
beneath our cold skies we are every year reminded of decay and
death in the withering grass, the falling leaves, and the bare
branches of winter; the long waiting for Spring bids us look
forward to a future away from this scene of death. In the jungle
there is no death, the leaves fall while they are still green, and in
a night, lo! new ones take their place; an ancient tree falls, but
the mighty trunk does not lie arid and stiff to be slowly covered
with pale leathery lichens; hardly has it touched the ground
before it is covered with a translucent shroud of tender green,
which seems but a renewal and continuation of its own life; and
before the burning sun shining through the gap can scorch the
delicate orchids, the gap is closed by a new eager growth and a
young tree springs from the earth upturned by the broken roots.
Can any dweller amid such scenes believe otherwise than that
death is but an exchange of life?</p>

<p>Of what can be called a religion the Borneans have little; they
are, to a certain extent, idolaters, and their projects are banned or
blest by omens drawn from certain birds and animals, but mainly
by auguries interpreted from the livers of sacrificed swine and from
fowls; wherein they are no more barbarous than the ancient
Romans. But the one custom, to which they all cling with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
tenacity born of what is to them its proved efficacy, is the taking
of human heads. Can they not recount indisputable proof after
proof, drawn from their own veritable experience, that these
precious influences over the domestic hearth bring the very
purest of blessings, and health, and wealth to the whole household?</p>

<p>Be it borne in mind that an enemy’s head is not like the scalp
of our American Indians, a mere trophy; it is an object of heartfelt
veneration, an earnest of blessing to the whole community.
Such is the round of life among them that a pretext for a head-hunt
is readily found; the solemn ceremony of putting off the
mourning for a dead Chief suggests it; or when a harvest is
completed; or when a Chief takes a new wife, etc. In all these
ceremonies the acquisition of new heads is of prime importance,
and those, too, who did not participate in the hunt, and even
very young boys, may share in the glory of this acquisition, if
they will merely put on war-clothes, and before the heads are
taken up into the house strike a blow at them with a parang.
[The ceremonies attending head-hunts I give elsewhere.] Water
sprinkled from the palm leaves, wherein the heads have been
wrapped, purifies women after periods of mourning, and they
may once more wear their ornaments, and bathe in the river, and
the men may thereafter shave their temples. When finally hung
up in the house, the heads have lost all semblance to life, and
are mere blackened skulls, not exactly ornamental, it must be
admitted, but by no means as repulsive as might be at first
supposed.</p>

<p>Among the Kayans it is most strictly forbidden for any
one, except the very aged, to touch these heads. Sickness,
possibly death, follows a disregard of this rule; but the aged,
who are at any rate on the brink of the grave, may fearlessly
handle them. At a harvest festival, it is an Iban
custom to take the old skulls down, and women then carry
them, together with the new ones, in their dances; rice is thrust
between the jaws, and arrack poured over them, that they also,
to the extent of their limited capacity, may share in the feast.</p>

<p>[This account of Aban Avit’s conversation is more or less
composite; the words which I have put into his mouth are not
solely his, but there is none of them that I have not heard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
emphatically expressed by other natives; I have merely made
one man the mouth-piece of several. The story of the sacrifice
of the old woman for the moral and physical training of the
boys, I have endeavored to give as I heard it.]</p>

<p>In the accompanying view of the veranda of Aban Avit’s
house, the skulls may be seen hanging in a cluster over the fireplace
around which the people are grouped. For this photograph
a trap-door in the roof had to be raised to admit light.
Draped over the skulls, here and there, are pieces of bark cloth
and shreds of palm leaves; the framework whereon the heads
are hung is made of hoops of rattan, one inside the other, so
that these invaluable relics may be arranged in a thick symmetrical
cluster. Among some tribes it is customary to place the
skull of a rhinoceros in the centre of the group of human skulls.
This animal is so ferocious and so hard to kill that it is deemed
worthy of the honor. Along the roof, half across the open trap-door,
is the board mentioned above, carved at its lower edge into
hooks, on which visitors hang their parangs while they sit to
talk or feast with the Chief. The man with his feet resting upon
the edge of the fireplace is the brother of Aban Avit, and will
probably succeed to the Chiefship; his word even now seems to
carry great weight in all councils. At the time of taking the
photograph the house was filled with guests,—a party of peace
from the Baram River, on their way to the head-waters of the
Tinjar to give and take pledges of friendly relationship, and to
pay off and collect indemnities for the raids and slaughterings of
their fathers and grandfathers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_WAR_EXPEDITION"><i>A WAR EXPEDITION</i></h2>

</div>

<p>About a year and a half before my first visit to Borneo,
a Chinese trader, in the upper Tinjar River, had been killed
solely for the sake of his head. Killing is by no means uncommon
in Borneo; but this was a murder so cold-blooded, and the
victim, moreover, a Chinaman, so unprepared for the game of
head-hunting, that an unusual effort was made to find and
punish the murderer. Although the head, just after it was cut
off, had been hung up in the veranda of a house, and although
the river-bank in front had been enlivened with a ‘Death-post,’
whereto portions of the victim had been attached, by way of public
notice that a head had just been taken, the perpetrator of the
deed showed, however, a guilty reluctance in claiming any glory,
or even in making himself known; furthermore, not a member of
that household, nor of any household on the Tinjar River, would
give the slightest clue to the identity of the murderer. All the
Chiefs, hitherto trusted, told endless lies about the crime, and
with such success that they believed that they had at last baffled
and befooled the ‘Prenta,’ the <i>Government</i>.</p>

<p>One day, about two years after the murder, a Malay trader,
who had been up among the Tinjar people for many months, and
was perhaps feeling a little sore over his poor bargains, let fall
to Dr. Hose, the English Resident of the Baram district, some
hints that again set in motion the wheels of justice and soon
fastened the guilt of that murder on Tinggi, a dweller in the
house of Tama Talip. The culprit was at once summoned to
appear for trial at the Baram Fort, but his people hid him and
resolutely defied the Government; consequently, a reward was
offered for his capture alive, or for his head, if dead. Nevertheless,
the Tinjar people continued to conceal and protect Tinggi,
even after an influential Chief had been deposed by the Government
for his duplicity in the matter, and, possibly, for the transparent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
quality of the lies he manufactured. There remained, therefore,
nothing to be done but to appoint an entire stranger, a native
from another river, to lead an expedition against the Lerons, the
tribe that was protecting Tinggi. The man thus appointed was
Tama Bulan, a Kenyah, and the most influential Chief in the
Baram district, who accepted the appointment and gathered a
force to ascend the Tinjar. Among his followers was Juman, a
Kayan Chief and the lucky and sole possessor of a gun. Tama
Bulan had been strictly commanded to take Tinggi, and no one
else but Tinggi; on no account was he to suffer his Kayan or
Kenyah followers to kill innocent people. Juman, with a small
party ascended the Tinjar, to a point opposite the house of the
Lerons. Tinggi, the murderer, emerged unattended from the
house, entered a light canoe, and was crossing the river,
apparently to surrender himself, when, at the last moment, he
seemed to change his mind, and resolved to attempt an escape.
In an instant, taking advantage of the swift current, he was dashing
past Juman’s camp. The details of his death I had, as follows,
from Juman himself: ‘Tinggi came down the river, Tuan,
lying flat in his canoe until he was just opposite to me and my
men; then he stood up, straight, brandishing his spear and his
parang, and shouting defiance to us all. But,’ continued Juman,
his eyes glowing with excitement, ‘I was all ready, Tuan; I
raised this “snappang”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of mine, that the Government gave
me; it was loaded full of nails; and I shot that insect, Tinggi,
right here,—through the breast. Over he fell backward in his
boat; he kept on waving his arms; I paddled fast after him in a
canoe; I got along side of him; I caught hold of his head;
I pulled it over to the edge of the boat; with two chops of
my parang, like that and like that, off it came.’</p>

<p>This head was the first Juman had ever taken, and measureless
was his pride in displaying the tattooing, to which he
was thereby entitled, on the back of one of his hands; the other
hand was to be similarly decorated as soon as the harvesting
was over. Tinggi’s head he was allowed to hang from
the roof of his veranda, opposite his door, in his house at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Bowang Takun. Although this slaying of Tinggi was retributive
justice, yet according to Borneo sentiment, it was a <i>causa
belli</i>, and when I arrived at the Baram River, on a second
visit to Borneo, about three months after these events, there
were already reports of retaliating expeditions led by Tinggi’s
brother, Kilup, in which the Tinjar people generally joined,
against the peaceful dwellers on the Baram; women had been
frightened from the rice-clearings by the traces of recent camp-fires,
and of fresh footprints in the adjacent jungle, and doubtless
would have been attacked, and killed, and decapitated,
had not their husbands mounted guard each day, clad in war-coat
and war-cap, and fully armed with spear, parang, and shield.
Reports of new disturbances and threatened outrage came by
every canoe from up the river that halted at the Baram Bazaar,
until finally Dr. Hose determined to crush out this portentous
feud betimes before it reached greater and, possibly, unmanageable
proportions.</p>

</figure>

<p>The whole Kayan population of the river was, moreover,
somewhat in a commotion, owing to the accidental death of
Oyang Luhat, one of its influential Chiefs. The control of three
or four hundred people had thus fallen to his eldest son, Abun,
and the large household were beginning to fret under the tedious
restraints of the prolonged mourning; these restraints could be
removed only by adding to the household collection a beneficent
fresh head or two; consequently, under a new and vigorous
young leader there was imminent danger of an extensive and
formidable raid upon all the Tinjar people. Furthermore, it
happened to be just at the beginning of the rainy season, when
there was nothing to be done but to wait for the rice, already
planted, to sprout and grow. Even in highly civilized communities,
Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do, so,
too, in Borneo what can be more natural than that days of
idleness should prompt a mischievous use of spear and parang?</p>

<p>His Excellency, Rajah Brooke, (this wise and beneficent
ruler,) has, of course, made every possible effort to eradicate the
custom of head-hunting in Sarawak, but in a country without
roads, and where news travels no faster than the river’s sluggish
current, swift retribution for any outrage is impossible; and, with
the small force of Englishmen who act as his Residents, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
almost inconceivably difficult, in districts isolated by well-nigh
impenetrable jungle, to follow up and arrest any offender, much
more a head-hunter, whom the natives themselves, holding head-hunting
to be a most praiseworthy virtue, screen to the best of
their ability.</p>

<p>Where the decapitated victim has relatives or near and dear
friends, there the Rajah’s officers may possibly obtain some aid;
but even under these favorable conditions, the information is
reluctantly given, unless the hope is held out of a participation
in the punishment or the retaliation.</p>

<p>In such circumstances, it is remarkable and redounds greatly
to the efficiency of the Sarawak government, that exceedingly
few murderers escape detection and punishment, even
should it take years to trace them. The punishment is not
always a death sentence; it may be a heavy fine. The veneration
with which the practice of head-hunting is regarded by the
tribes of the central high-lands, and the fact that they have been
taught by their fathers and grandfathers that it is a religious
duty, cannot but influence the Rajah and his Residents to incline
to leniency in their judicial sentences on these people whenever
there has been provocation, albeit slight, for the commission of
the deed. Where a whole household of more than a hundred
men has made an unprovoked raid upon an unsuspecting neighbor,
the Rajah, on several occasions, has wisely allowed the
injured tribe to make, as a kind of ‘wild justice,’ a retaliating raid
upon the aggressors; but the expedition has been always under
the direction of one of his Residents, who makes sure that only
the guilty are attacked,—if unrestrained, the natives would be
driven by excitement to kill all who cross their path, whether
friend or foe.</p>

<p>To resume the story of the troublous times on the Baram.
It was decided by the Government to quiet the disturbances at
the very outset by administering a severe lesson to those turbulent
natives on the Tinjar who still resented the legal slaying
of the murderer, Tinggi; accordingly, a war expedition was
planned, which should be the means of intimidating the seditious
tribe, without, it was ardently hoped, the shedding of any blood,
and, withal, of such an imposing character that the mere demonstration
might, of itself, lead even to a lasting peace.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>COUNCIL OF WAR, DURING A MARCH TO THE HOUSE OF
AN ENEMY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Hose decided, first of all, to investigate the truth of the
rumours concerning the marauding Lerons. With this end in
view, he decided to set out at once for the house of the young
Chief, Abun, just mentioned, about one hundred and twenty
miles up the Baram, where, if the rumours proved correct, his
forces could be mustered.</p>

<p>We arrived after dark at Long Lama (‘Long’ meaning
the <i>mouth of a river</i>, and ‘Lama’ being the name of a stream
at whose junction with the Baram Abun’s house is situated).
The river’s bank, sloping gradually in low, irregular terraces of
sandy mud up to the house, about a hundred and fifty yards from
the shore, was dotted in all directions with little fires, whereon
the natives were cooking venison. A deer had been killed in the
clearings, and, although the flesh is one of the greatest of delicacies,
it must never be cooked in the house; the timidity of the deer
will be infused into the household. By inhaling its spirit, liberated
by fire, young men assimilate its timidity and become
cowards in battle,—therefore the flesh is cooked in the open
air, and the timid spirit at once makes its way again to the
jungle. Several of the natives, when they recognized us, deserted
their flesh-pots and came down to meet us, carrying fire-brands,
which they waved vigorously to keep them blazing and give us
light. Of course, all knew that a visit from the Resident meant
something of importance, but, according to Kayan etiquette,
the purpose must not be broached until we were settled in the
veranda. Escorted by these torch-bearers we picked our way
past the fires up the soggy, muddy bank, walked warily on
the pathway of slippery logs, and so to the notched log
whereby the veranda is gained.</p>

<p>The immense long-house, looking on its high, multitudinous
piles like a gigantic centipede, stretched far away to the right and
to the left into the darkness under rustling cocoanut palms; mongrel
dogs barked and yapped round our heels, and from beneath
the house snorting pigs rushed hither and thither in all directions.
The house seemed deserted; the restrictions of mourning had
banished all mirth, music, and song; the only signs of life along
its whole length were three or four dim fires flickering on the clay
hearths; hardly a sound was to be heard in it. With as much
dignity as can be assumed when crawling on all fours up an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
almost perpendicular, and slippery, and notched pole, we gained
the veranda, where the young Chief greeted us cordially, and
ceremoniously conducted us to the clay hearth, the place of
honor, in front of his own door. Fresh wood to replenish the
fire was brought, and several small tin kerosene lamps, made by
Chinese at the Bazaar, and without glass chimneys, were placed
here and there, on the floor, and on the beams. It was not
advisable, even had it been etiquette, to divulge at once the purpose
of our visit, or even to allude to the Tinjar people; so dropping
cross-legged about the fire, we accepted the proffered bead-work
box of coarse Kayan tobacco and banana-leaf wrappers,
and joined the encircling and rapidly increasing group, in a social
cigarette. The talk drifted up-river and down-river, discussing
crops of rice and the promise of the abundance of rattan, or of
gutta, or of camphor yet to be gathered in the jungle. Occasional
puffs of hot air were wafted in under the eaves, bringing
with them the combined scent of the fires on the bank, of mud,
and of damp chips from the logs which beneath the house were
being fashioned into canoes. The brief twilight of the tropics
was gone, the night was already as black as ink, although it was
barely a half hour after sunset, and the insects had not yet
begun the incessant din of their nocturnal medley.</p>

<p>Gradually, Dr. Hose led up the conversation to the killing of
Tinggi and to the retaliation of the Lerons. At once eyes flashed,
and every man was eager to set forth his account of the outrages;
some asserted that women and children working in the rice-fields
had been murdered; others maintained that certain rattan-cutters
had caught sight of a large force of Tinjar people, in the jungle
close by Long Lama; again, others said that the Tinjar marauders
numbered hundreds, while others contended that there were,
at most, but a dozen or so. Finally, it turned out that no one
present had actually seen a single enemy, and the substance of the
stories was so flimsy that the purpose of the expedition threatened
to come to naught, when suddenly our ears caught the
rhythmical and rapid thump of paddles, followed by the grating
sound of the beaching of canoes. Flickering torches struggled
up the bank toward the house, and, as though by telepathy, it
flashed upon every one that Juman himself was at hand.</p>

</figure>

<p>Presently, sure enough, in came the hero of the hour, with fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
or twenty followers. All took their places amid the squatting
group, as unconcernedly as if their minds were as free of care, as
their bodies of clothes. Juman seated himself beside us on the
low platform. Again, we had to comply with the inviolable
rules of Bornean propriety, and converse on any subject under
heaven, save on the sole object of the visit; but this time it did
not take so long to beat about the bush. After a few decorous
minutes, Juman, jumping to his feet, poured forth to the assembly
a harrowing account of the horrid dangers to which his household
was exposed every hour of the day and night from this
crowd of skulking, murderous Lerons! He spoke in Kayan, a
language of soft, lingual, and prolonged vowel sounds, abruptly
interspersed with short gutturals pronounced far back in the
throat; and while relating his wrongs he stamped with his bare
feet, turning first to this side, then to that, wildly waving his arms,
snapping his fingers, and emphasising the close of each sentence
by shouting ‘Bahh! bahh!’—a convenient exclamation to gain
time for ideas; I fear it corresponded to the cough which afflicts
our own after-dinner speakers. The telling point of the speech
was that the camp of the enemy had been actually discovered
close to Juman’s own fields, and, from the way that the jungle
had been trodden down, the war-party must be in large numbers;
much of the rice had been uprooted just as it was beginning to
sprout, and many of their banana trees had been wantonly
slashed to pieces. There were men here with Juman,—he called
them forth and bade them tell their stories,—who had actually
seen the encampment of the enemy, and the hundreds of footprints
on the bank of the stream where they had rested. Juman
was clearly an orator, and swayed at will the emotions of the
assembly; volleys of grunts marked approval of his eager words;
cigarettes burned quick and fast under excited puffing.</p>

<p>When Juman dropped on his haunches, there followed an
ominous silence,—the hush before a storm. Dr. Hose at once
perceived that the native blood was deeply stirred, and that these
reports about the Lerons, who had no right to be in this part of
the country at all, were probably correct, and would infallibly lead
to an indiscriminate war. The thirst of the people for vengeance
must not be absolutely thwarted, but judiciously controlled.
Accordingly, he at once addressed them very earnestly, approving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
of their just indignation, and fearlessly telling them that the
reason why their expeditions so often failed was because they
lost so much time in consulting Omen Birds, that the enemy
had time to prepare themselves or to decamp. Now was the
hour when the lives of their wives and children depended upon
instant action, and he impressively concluded by saying:—</p>

<p>‘This time do not ask advice from birds, get ready to-night
at once, and we’ll all start at dawn to-morrow and chase these
thieves and cowards back to their river! or else many fresh
heads will hang in the houses on the Baram! But remember,
that though the Government is with you in this fight, it makes
war on the guilty, and on no one but the guilty. Go, therefore!
Send messengers without delay, up-river and down, to summon
all Kayan fighters to arms! And to be ready to join us to-morrow
before the birds wake up!’</p>

<p>For several seconds every man sat motionless with dilated eyes
and open mouth, hardly realising the joyful news. Then with one
wild shout all bounded to their feet, and the whole house from
end to end was staring wide awake and fairly quivering with life!
Canoes were hastily launched in the darkness and dispatched
up and down the black river, to bear the swift news to friendly
houses miles away. The slamming of doors was incessant, dusty
and long unused spears, shields, war-coats, caps, were eagerly
brought from sleeping-rooms into the veranda, for inspection, or
for repairs, or for fresh decorations. Clay lamps with damar-gum
sizzling, sputtering, and smoking, were lit everywhere.
Crouched about one lamp was a group of young men warming
fresh ‘Ipoh’ (<i>arrow poison</i>), and smearing it on the tips of the
darts for their blow-pipes. Around another, was gathered a group
busily cutting new darts and shaping the pith butts to fit tightly
in the bore of the blow-pipe. Others sharpened their spears and
parangs, rearranging the dangling charms, which they smeared
with the blood of chickens, while murmuring exhortations to them
to protect the bearer from all harm and help the parang to deal
death at a single blow. All the women, too, and the girls, joined
in the hurry-scurry, and stitched, on the backs of war-coats, horn-bill
feathers, or big butterflies embroidered in black and yellow
beads. Many a love-knot was tied, that night, and fastened on
parang, war-coat, and shield, and I am quite sure that some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
young hearts beat high with hopes of presenting, as the fairest
of bridal gifts, what no female Kayan heart could possibly resist,—a
lovely, fresh, human head. But, perhaps, I was too sentimental,
and imputed romantic aspirations to those dusky breasts
which entertained no such lodgers. For as I sat there passively
watching this strange scene, so dramatic and unreal to me, and
so earnest and real to the actors, I saw a girl with serious
mien furtively thrust into a young warrior’s hand a strip of bead-work
of her own making, wherewith to ornament the scabbard of
his parang. I am sorry to say that, so far from responding to
any tender sentiment, the young fellow looked decidedly sheepish,
and not a little puzzled by the gift, and, alas! I could not
detect that he even thanked her for it. Half an hour later I
saw him wandering about, dangling the precious love-token aimlessly
in his hand. I concluded that she had better throw him
over; such ardour as his, never leads to where glory waits.</p>

<p>Hearing vigorous stamping and loud shouting in the room
of the young Chief, Abun, I entered unbidden. In the middle
of the room, which was unusually large, stood an old warrior
decked out in war-coat and cap, and brandishing a spear in one
hand and a shield in the other; around him in a circle sat eight
or ten young men watching breathlessly his every movement.</p>

<p>It was difficult to repress a smile at his antics; but the
intense earnestness and wrapt attention of his pupils were absolute;
he was instructing the novices how to lunge, guard, and
parry with spear and shield. With a shrill shout and a lofty
caper he dashed at an imaginary foe, warded off the attack with
his shield, and, crouching low behind it, gave imaginary crippling
jabs with his spear, emitting loud grunts the while, and hopping
from right to left at each thrust; these thrusts were evidently
fatal to the phantom foe, for, dropping his spear, the hoary
instructor drew his parang, and with one chop, followed by sawing,
severed an imaginary head from its body. His final explosive
grunt, expressed as plain as words: ‘There it is! off at last!
simple as kiss your hand!’ Again, he backed and sidled to show
the motions when an enemy attacks in the rear; or, again, he
showed how to creep stealthily, and at the same time to keep the
body thoroughly covered by the shield, which, considering that
this protecting article is four feet long by eighteen inches wide,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
cannot be called a difficult problem. Of course, the enemy was
always stupid and completely deceived by the baldest feints, and
inevitably fell an easy prey. But the open-eyed and open-mouthed
youngsters drank in the instruction in gulps. Their
instructor could not be called a handsome old man, his nose was
a flattened aquiline, his lips thin and pushed far forward like a
frog’s; his hands were, of course, tattooed, for his knowledge of
warfare had been gained in many a battle, and his contribution
to the household collection of heads was large; his hair was
cropped short, (probably out of respect for the late Chief,) and
stood up in gray bristles all over his head; his muscular development,
however, was fine for a man of his years, and his litheness
and agility were remarkable.</p>

<p>The alcove where I sat, watching this military drill, was the
sleeping platform of the old widowed mother of the Chief; her
mats had been already spread for the night, before this war excitement
had begun. She sat beside me, speaking earnestly and bravely
to her three sons, Abun, Madong, and Batu, squatting in front of
her, each busily engaged, while listening to her, in selecting from
their store the best darts for their blow-pipes, and replacing with
new butts any old ones which were dry or cracked. ‘Be brave,
sons of mine,’ she said, in earnest tones, ‘and remember your
father, Oyang Luhat, the bravest of the brave, the friend of the
Rajah, and one who obeyed every command of the Government.
Bring back, I implore you, an enemy’s head, that your fearless
father’s grave may be honoured with a fragment of it. Obey the
orders of the Tuan Resident; if he forbids you to kill, then
come back empty handed rather than disobey the Prenta. If you
are killed, of course I shall wail and lament for you; but I am
old, and shall meet you soon again with your father in Long
Julán, where all brave warriors go who die in battle or by accident.
And you, Batu, [the youngest, about eighteen years
old,] be not headstrong, but follow your brothers and take their
advice in everything.’</p>

<p>Her words were so simple and direct, and, withal, uttered
in that soft, flowing language which I had learned to like so
well, that, I confess, it never entered my mind at the time that
her personal appearance was far from prepossessing. I saw in
her only a modern instance of the Spartan mother, and quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
forgot her few and blackened teeth, and her slit ear-lobes,
enormously elongated by her mourning ear-rings of heavy wood.
She sat on the floor half leaning back against the wall, with only
a strip of blue cotton cloth (not immaculate) around her waist,
and covering as far as the knee her thin, wrinkled, and tattooed
legs, while she was addressing her three boys, of whom she was
very proud. Her eyes, dimmed from age and from the daily glare
of the sun, rested first on one, then on another, but most frequently
on the youngest, Batu, whose marriage was to take place
as soon as the tattooing on the legs of his bride was finished.
Evidently her mother’s heart feared lest this high prize of his
enamoured hopes, coupled with his youth, might spur him on
to hazard more danger than his brothers. The ardour of the
hour was contagious, and I saw (honesty bids me acknowledge)
nothing unnatural or unmotherly in these prayers to her sons to
bring home a freshly severed head, to hang in consecrated repose
above the domestic hearth or on an honoured father’s grave.</p>

<p>In the veranda, all the bustle and excitement were continued;
fresh recruits kept constantly arriving from neighbouring houses,
and from rice-clearings, where men often pass the night in small
huts. Outside, in front of the house, in the granaries for rice,
there was also much commotion, the commissariat department
must not be overlooked; a good store of rice had to be packed
in baskets and bags of a size convenient for handling. In this
work, the youngsters could help, and the sturdy little chaps,
infected with the excitement of their elders, forgot sleep, and
shouted and laughed as they darted here and there, and stumbled
in the dark, carrying the baskets down to the canoes at the river’s
edge.</p>

<p>Long before the excited stir and confusion had subsided, we
were stretched out on our mats upon the floor to snatch a few
hours of sleep before dawn; whether or not the natives slept at
all is doubtful; when we awoke at the first streaks of gray in the
east, the bustle of embarking was at its height.</p>

<p>Just as the first red beams of level light came gleaming down
the long stretch of the river, five of the most energetic canoes
swung out from the shore, and a mighty shout went up from
their sixty or seventy paddlers; the foam and spray dashed and
sparkled and glittered from the paddles; the thwarts creaked in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
their rattan bindings as the canoes fairly bent and quivered
under the powerful strokes. Away they darted up-stream racing
for the lead, the snow-white feathers in the warriors’ caps and on
the war-coats, glittered like burnished silver as they fluttered and
caught the glancing sunlight.</p>

<p>Every few minutes, canoes from down-stream, filled with warriors
in panoply, came into view, just touched at the landing,
asked a few breathless, excited questions, swerved off,
and dashed after the leaders. The women, in a long line,
leaned over the railing of the veranda, and, let us hope, ‘rained
influence;’ certain it is that between the puffs of their cigarettes
they broadly smiled encouragement to their lovers and husbands,
who (it pains me to add) paid absolutely no attention to them.
When ten or twelve canoes had started off, we followed in our
big canoe, manned by Ibans from the Baram Fort, who, though
of a different tribe, love fighting as passionately as do the
Kayans. Not to be outdone, we started off with as brave a
splash and as vigorous a shout as the best of them, and very
soon had caught up with the main body of canoes that were just
behind those that were the first to break the placid water and
catch the full beams of the rising sun.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was a thrilling scene! It was war, savage war, and
a war of savages. However it might end, be it bloody or bloodless,
now at the outset fierce eagerness lit up all faces, and a
frenzy for blood had mounted to every brain.</p>

<p>As we rounded a turn of the river we came to a sudden
pause. The advance guard of five canoes had hauled up to the
shore. On a narrow sandy bank an excited crowd of warriors
were kindling a fire and putting up poles and arches of sticks cut
along their whole length into curled shavings,—a bird of good
omen had been seen on the right side! An exhilarating proof
that, although the usual rites had been neglected, the blessed
birds were, after all, propitious. The fire, an unfailing messenger
from man to the omniscient Omen-givers, now announced to the
birds that their favour was greatly appreciated. All the maturer
men, pre-eminent among them our old friend, the whilom
instructor in the warlike use of shield and spear, evidently also
a pronounced and respectable conservative, were overjoyed, and
danced, and shouted, round the fire before returning to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
boats. Although no such spur was needed, yet unquestionably
this favourable omen imparted a fierce exultant joy to all, and
we started off with redoubled zeal.</p>

</figure>

<p>The canoes kept fairly close together all day, but as the sun
mounted higher and higher, and was at last directly overhead,
the paddling became somewhat less vigorous; cumbersome war-coats
and caps were placed in a heap in the centre of each boat.
Three or four times we all halted and cooled ourselves off by a
plunge in the stream, which, now that we had passed the lowlands,
ran beautifully clear. Whenever we approached friendly
houses, the paddling became furious, the shoutings and cries
from all throats were renewed; to which, as a response, several
canoes full of eager warriors would unfailingly push out from
shore to join us. Then again was the air filled with a wild din
of savage whoops and halloos, and thrills of excitement ran from
boat to boat.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, under the westering sun, we reached
Juman’s house at Bowang Takun; the house is a large one
standing at some little distance back from the river and almost
hidden under a luxuriant grove of cocoanut palms. Why the
spot should be called <i>Onion Lake</i>, seeing that there are neither
onions nor lakes there, is as inexplicable as some of the Bornean
conventional tattoo designs. There is a slimy pond, to be sure,
near the house, which as it is water might suggest a lake,
and its exceedingly bad odor might supply a reminder of the
vegetable.</p>

<p>As the day’s journey closed at Juman’s house, Juman very
naturally claimed the privilege of acting as host to this large
party. Furthermore, was he not the indirect,—but most happy
cause, of this delightful war? Was not its joyous pretext to
avenge his wrongs? Surely it was his pleasant duty then to
feed the warriors royally. (And let me say in parenthesis that to
supply, at a few hours’ notice, food and lodging for four or five
hundred men might well task any hospitality save that of a Bornean.)
Accordingly, his boats had pushed on ahead at the
double quick, and reached his house several hours before us.
When the forty or fifty canoes (with an average of at least ten
men to a canoe) drew up to Juman’s beach, the slaughtering of
pigs and fowls was still going on, and great troughs full of boiled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
rice were in preparation. In order not to be in the way, the
whole army filled in the spare time by bathing in the river, and
by washing their chawats, (<i>waist-cloths</i>,) which were spread out
on the pebbly beach, and, until they were dried, the owners
remained in the water. Before dark, all were summoned to the
supper, which was spread in the veranda for the common folk,
and in Juman’s own room for the select few. In two rows on
the floor down the centre of the whole length of Juman’s room,
where we dined, were squares of banana leaf, each one piled high
with boiled rice, and beside each cover stood a little bowl of
wood or of coarse china, filled with cubes of boiled pork and
chicken. Between the rows, about every three feet, were large
wooden bowls heaped with pulverised salted fish; these bowls
were in common, all hands might dive into them for a savory
pinch. As soon as all were squatted, some began to fall to
at once; whereupon Juman shouted the obligatory welcome,
‘Kuman plahei plahei,’ which, as I have said, means <i>eat slowly</i>.
He had no shade of fear that his guests would not eat heartily,—the
duration of the meal must be long,—‘the linked sweetness
long drawn out.’ Mrs. Juman and little Miss Juman (I failed
to catch their names when I was presented), and several little
Jumans were ubiquitous in their zeal that all should be helped,
that every one should have plenty; when this was assured,
they sat on one side and helped themselves. It was a remarkably
quiet feast, all attention was absorbed in disposing of the
food with neatness, and, in spite of the injunction of Kuman
plahei plahei, with dispatch. Considering that all the eating
was performed without knife, fork, spoon, or even chop-sticks,
the cleanliness with which they all ate, brought a blush to our
cheeks when we contemplated the quantity of rice scattered about
our places when we had finished.</p>

<p>Darkness closed in soon after supper; the men all gathered in
groups in the veranda. Again and again the stories about the
hiding-place of the enemy were rehearsed, and those who had
been among the fortunate discoverers of this hiding-place never
lacked an interested party of listeners, who accepted implicitly
every embellishment which each repetition brought forth. The
plans for the expedition to the clearings on the following day
were discussed, and, in a sort of Council of War, it was finally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
decided that the whole band should preserve as closed ranks as
possible, and sedulously use every expedient in the jungle to
indicate to the foe their formidable numbers. In case the enemy
had scattered only to reassemble, its scouts would become aware
of the perfectly equipped and enormous force with which it had to
deal. (I mention these details to show that this expedition was
not a mere armed mob, but that the leaders had some inkling of
the rudiments of genuine tactics.) Every one was keen for the
fight; a protracted peace on the Baram had made the people
restless; the heads hanging from the rafters in the houses were
becoming exceedingly dusty, and their beneficent virtue was,
possibly, evaporating.</p>

</figure>

<p>By the time, however, that all the excited rumors of the number
of the foe, and of its movements, had been thoroughly sifted,
I think I could detect indications that several of the older and
cooler headed Chiefs began to waver in their belief that there
would be after all any desperate conflict; possibly even, that this
fierce show, with all the paraphernalia of war, would in itself
prove all-sufficient, and that the enemy would be so intimidated
that it would make no stand.</p>

<p>As the evening wore on and the damar lamps burned low with
fitful sputters, I deserted the Council of War, and joined a group
where care had been cast to the winds, and, by tacit consent, the
evening before the battle was to be as gay and festive as possible.
A youth was playing on the kaluri, and a sharp-featured man of
middle age was the bard; he had a deep bass voice and seemed
to be widely recognized as the possessor of an endless repertoire
of songs,—every song that was called for, be it war-like, be it
pastoral, be it of love, or be it of the nursery, he was familiar
with, and at once launched into the solo, while the rest joined in
the refrain.</p>

<p>I could not follow word for word these Kayan songs, which
are often, no doubt, quite ancient. The unwritten languages of
all the Polynesian races are subject to remarkably rapid modifications;
wherefore the songs and legends which preserve their
original form are very difficult for modern and foreign ears to
understand. Juman sat cross-legged next to me, and interpreted
to me in Malay, from time to time, fragments of the songs; one,
I remember, had a very <i>catchy</i> rhythm with a constant refrain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
‘<i>Tama Poyong kapei paha, Ara wi wi ará</i>.’ According to Juman,
it was a woful ballad rehearsing the lament of a young girl to
her mother because she had been commanded to marry ‘Tama
Poyong, with the twisted leg;’ her plaintive objections to Tama
Poyong as a husband, on various grounds, sent Juman and all
the rest of the group into such fits of laughter that they could
hardly join in the chorus, and, of course, I laughed in sympathy.
Another song was of the workers in the fields, and then followed
a minute account of the harvest-festival, when women dress like
men in nothing but a chawat, and parade about the house in a
long procession carrying shield, parang, and spear. The solo
singer sat in the centre of the group, and with a smile glanced
here and there about him in a half-embarrassed way, keeping
time to his song by twirling the free end of his chawat round
and round in front of him, and at times, for emphasis, whacking
it down on his knee. Whenever women were represented as
speaking, he broke into a high falsetto.</p>

<p>So the evening wore on till one by one the singers crept away,
and soon, wrapped in their long, white cotton coverings, were
stretched along the veranda like a row of corpses in shrouds.</p>

<p>The next morning the excitement in getting off in the boats
that there had been at Long Lama was repeated. Eight or
ten more canoes from up-river joined us just as we set out,
making the total number of the fleet at least sixty, carrying
about six hundred,—truly a very formidable army of keen,
savage warriors. After ascending the river a short distance, the
canoes fell into single file and turned into a narrow tributary
stream, leading up to the rice-clearings.</p>

<p>On both sides, trees arched over the stream in a dense canopy;
thick with orchids, ferns, and vines, which sent their blossoms,
roots, and tendrils down, in heavy masses, almost sweeping our
heads; gorgeous butterflies flickered and fluttered in their uncertain
flight just above the surface of the water or gathered, like
flaming jewels, on patches of mud on the banks; hordes of monkeys,
aroused by the unusual bustle and turmoil on the river,
peered, and chattered, and jeered at us from a safe distance above;
while the harsh and deep-toned calls of the horn-bills boomed
and echoed from the depths of the jungle.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus35" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus35.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>POLING CANOES OVER SWIFT BUT SHALLOW RAPIDS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For several hours we zigzagged up the stream, following the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
deeper courses where the current ran less swift, under shady,
far-reaching boughs, whose tips dabbled in the rippling water;
gradually the stream narrowed and ran between rocks and
pebbled islands. Paddles were ineffectual against the swift current,
and the men halted to cut poles. One by one, the long line of
canoes again moved off, the men grunting in chorus at each
shove of the poles, whose successive movements travelled along
the line like the rippling legs of a centipede; the man in the bow
raises his pole and sweeps it ahead for a fresh hold, then the
next man behind, on the opposite side of the boat, does likewise
with the same motion, and so down the whole line, each waiting
till the man in front has his pole firmly fixed. Then all the
twenty together, with a profound and mighty grunt, give a shove
that sends the boat ahead for fifteen or twenty feet.</p>

<p>By this time, we had approached so near to the lurking-place
of the enemy that it was deemed advisable to have scouts sent
ahead, especially to see that there were no trees on the banks
which had been partially chopped through and were kept in
position only by the vines binding them to adjoining trees; a
fatal trap for enemies often used by the Borneans. When the
trees are half cut through, it needs but a single blow with a
parang to sever the vines that hold it and then down it goes
crashing on the boats of an enemy, and while the occupants
flounder in the water and are entangled among broken branches,
nothing is easier than to reap an abundant and soothing harvest
of human heads.</p>

<p>Thus we slowly toiled up the shallow water in the crawling
canoes, while scouts kept abreast in the jungle, cutting a path
for themselves in the dense tangle of thorny palms and rattans.
Foremost among them were Abun, the Chief, and his youthful and
ardent brother, Batu. They were as alert as hawks, peering
everywhere for indications of the earnestly desired foe. Every
now and then my eyes were dazzled by flashes from a diamond-shaped
decoration on Abun’s war-cap. When we disembarked
at noon I found that this glittering jewel was a tin trade-mark
stamped in familiar letters: ‘Devoe’s Brilliant Kerosene Oil.’</p>

<p>For some inexplicable reason, the Borneans never breakfast
before starting on any expedition; but, once started, they always
seem to choose the most inopportune time for their first meal;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
just when they have fallen fairly into the swing of paddling or
poling, they must needs land and build fires for cooking rice. Even
war permits no exception to this exasperating custom; so at noon
the whole fleet pulled up on a ‘karangan,’ or pebbly island,
where, in fulfillment of the strategy planned the night before,
fully a hundred fires were kindled under as many earthen pots,
and over a widely extended area. While the rice was boiling,
some energetic workers constructed a shelter with boughs and
large palm leaves to protect the Chiefs and the ‘Kalunan putih,’
(<i>white men</i>,) from the vertical rays of the sun, which beat down
pitilessly in this wide expanse of the stream, where a tributary,
almost equal in size, joined its broad waters. The smoke drifted
hazily and lazily into the thick, ever-dripping jungle, and the
water swirled over the smooth hidden rocks and broke into ‘unnumbered
smiles’ in the flecks of sunshine. War-caps and coats
were laid aside, and for an hour there was rest for warriors,
filled with peace and rice. It is to be feared that under this
soothing influence the pristine enthusiasm which marked the
start was slightly ebbing; ‘weary seemed the oar, and weary the
wandering fields of barren foam;’ there is no knowing how
much longer that hour would have lasted. Juman was keeping
himself a little in the background, now that his alarming
reports were so soon to be tested. Of a sudden the note of instant
war was struck by Ma Obat, (<i>Father of Medicine</i>,) of most fierce
aspect, but a braggart and at heart a coward; one of his eye-sockets
was empty and in the other rolled a bloodshot orb, whose
red lids, from which the lashes had been plucked, were everted.
He started up, and, with a shout to his men to be quick, or they
would never reach the enemy, bustled down to his boat, slipping
his head through his war-coat and girding on his parang, as he
went.</p>

<p>This sudden call broke the spell, and in a moment all were
scurrying to the boats, but not before every peg whereon the
pots had rested was with scrupulous care pulled up, and the
embers scattered;—nothing brings worse luck to a war-party
than the omission of this last duty in breaking camp. One by
one the canoes started off again up-stream; sometimes making
their way with difficulty between boulders, then again gliding
swiftly over placid pools, the poles rattling and splashing on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
pebbly bottom. Before long, we reached the head of navigation,
and here at last were the rice-clearings,—the very ground
whereon the foe had lately trod. For half a mile or more on the
left bank of the river, the jungle had been cleared and the surface
burnt, leaving only tall charred stumps of trees. Here and
there were scattered thatched huts on high poles, where the
guardians of the fields sleep at night; and all the undulating
ground about the scraggy charred tree stems, was clothed
thick with the lush, translucent green of sprouting rice.</p>

BREAKFAST.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The path now led up the bed of the stream, here dwindled
to a mere brook; the foliage was dense all about us, and all
were obliged to advance as stealthily as possible. Every face
was set, with keen eyes darting in every direction, and every
muscle tense. Not an instant but was fraught to all with possible
death; at any moment might come the sudden sharp sting
of a poisoned arrow from an invisible, noiseless blow-pipe. No
one picked his steps,—eyes could not be spared for that. The
trembling of a leaf might mean a fatal wound. It was a thrilling,
impressive hour. I suppose my heart would have beat
quicker, had I not had a firm conviction that the victims of the
unerring blow-pipe would be natives, not white men. Once I looked
over my shoulder, and smiled at Abun just behind me, with the
repoussé legend ‘Devoe’s oil’ glittering on his cap. He did not
return the smile, but gravely shook his head, in deprecation of
all lightmindedness in such a fateful time. Suddenly there was
a commotion in the advance guard, loud cries and vehement
talking. Then a quick movement forward. I thought we had
actually encountered the enemy, but just as suddenly every man
came to a halt and spears were grounded. Our foremost scouts
had come upon the camping-ground of the wily Lerons; a capacious
shelter of interlacing shrubs and overspread with large
leaves had been discovered; the earth was blackened and deep
with the ashes from their fires; round about, we found the
jungle beaten down, and while we were closely examining these
recent traces, one of our scouts came back in great excitement
to lead us to the edge of the clearing, where a treacherous ambush
had been made, whence a watch could be kept on the
labourers in the rice-fields and a sudden onslaught made upon
any unwary women or unarmed men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>The last doubt was now dispelled. Intruders with evil intent
had been skulking in the neighborhood, in considerable numbers,
and very recently,—but whither had they fled? Possibly, they
were in hiding, awaiting a favorable chance to attack, or else,
after we had given up the pursuit, to return to their deserted
ambush.</p>

<p>The little army, gathered on the banks and in the dry bed of
the stream, waited patiently until the scouts had returned from
fruitlessly searching the jungle far and wide. Then a council of
war was convened upon the karangan. It was of no use to
advance further unless to attack some household on the Tinjar;—this
was not advisable; no one knew with certainty from whose
house these hostile intruders had come, and indiscriminate vengeance
was out of the question where the Prenta was in the lead.</p>

<p>It was futile to attempt pursuit. The enemy was equipped
for land travel, which we were not, and, as they had at least a
day’s start, we could not hope to catch up with them. Bitter
was the disappointment to all. Many vehemently declared that
they were willing to go on, without rest or food, by night and
day, only let them taste the glorious excitement of a fight for
heads. Ma Obat turned his one seeing but unsightly eye on
Dr. Hose, and boldly said, (unblushingly of course, and in a
vainglorious tone,) ‘If the Tuan will let me go with only a few of
my men, I promise I’ll bring back heads; if I don’t find these
Lerons I know where to find some Ivans [thus pronounced by
Kayans] collecting gutta and rattans.’ After this display of
courage in killing unarmed victims, and of obedience to the
Government, he assumed an expression of great ferocity, and
rolled his cyclopean eye round the circle to note the effect of
his words. To any one who knew how untutored, how undisciplined,
how childlike are the minds of these savages, it could
hardly have been discouraging, certainly not surprising, to see
how many were the nods of approval which followed this treasonable
speech; the zealous old ‘fencing-master’ was, as might be
expected, decidedly on Ma Obat’s side, and a grizzled old warrior,
who, during the discussion, had seized the opportunity of cooling
himself off in a pool directly in view of the assembly, cried out,
waving his arms and lying flat on his back in the water, ‘That’s
the talk! that’s right! I’ll go with Ma Obat! and we’ll kill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
any one we meet, Ivan, Leron, Punan! any one is better than
no one.’</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>PARTY OF ARMED WARRIORS ON A NARROW TRAIL
IN THE JUNGLE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Ma Obat clearly knew his audience. I think he had really
voiced the universal sentiment. Fortunately, the Resident was
present, and the supreme head; never for a moment would he
allow the possibility of such an unbridled expedition to have a
lodgement in their minds. He turned to Abun, who had more
men under his command than any other Chief, and to him put
the question whether he would be willing to lead an expedition
into the country of the Lerons, and solemnly promise that
none but Leron men should be killed. The young fellow had a
hard struggle; ardently as he longed to approve his lately inherited
Chiefship by leading a head-hunt, and piously as he
desired to honour his father’s grave with a fresh head, he knew
the heavy fines the Government would impose on his House
if innocent people were killed, and he distrusted the precipitate
temper of his followers. All eyes were fixed on him as, for
several seconds, he sat silent, gazing intently at a little pile of
pebbles he was pushing up with his widespread toes. Then
without lifting his eyes he almost whispered to the Resident,
‘Tuan, I cannot promise so much for my men. Every one of
them has known me as a mere boy. Although they follow
me for my father’s sake, I cannot promise they will do as I command
when we get in sight of any dweller on the Tinjar, armed
or unarmed. No, I cannot lead the expedition and keep this
promise.’</p>

<p>At this reply, a grunt of unmistakable disapproval was
emitted by the whole circle, and, to prevent at once any more
insubordinate offers like Ma Obat’s, Dr. Hose immediately ended
all discussion by a diplomatic speech, delivered after their
fashion with great emphasis, and brought them all round (mere
children as they are) to believe that the expedition had been
a brilliant, absolute success. Was it not manifest that the
enemy had scattered, and fled in wild disorder before them?
Had not the real object of the war been gained? Were they
not glorious conquerors, every one of them, since all danger to
women and children had been removed? What hostile Leron
would now dare to lurk about the rice-clearings, after he had
noted the traces of this resolute army of invincible warriors?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
The only thing to do now was to start an enormous peace
expedition into the Tinjar country, and put an end, once for all,
to the present feuds by the payment and collection of ‘Usut’
[indemnity] and by the performance of ‘Jawa’ [a sham battle].</p>

<p>The speech was greeted with a shout as triumphant as if they
saw the backs of their enemy disappearing before them; they
sprang to their feet, and spears, shields, and parangs clattered,
and plumes waved, and so clearly were they victors, that, in
imagination, each warrior had a foeman’s head dangling at his
belt.</p>

<p>One and all turned to retrace their steps. Where but an hour
before, in strained silence, we had crept stealthily, now, that all
danger of a lurking foe was dispelled, we scrambled along,
laughing, shouting, clattering iron-shod spears on the stones,
and hurrying to be first at the boats. Abun, Madong, and
Batu did not share in this exultant mood; they alone seemed
down-hearted; they and their household must continue to endure
the burdensome restrictions of mourning.</p>

<p>It was during this straggling march that the ‘fencing-master,’
who was, it appears, a Past-Master in knowledge of all rites and
usages of war, and his word law, announced that in a case like
the present, where a war-party had failed to bring home a head
because the enemy had scattered, it was quite in accordance
with time-honoured, head-hunting custom to borrow a head;
the benign influence, from a relic thus rejuvenated by posing as
a head freshly taken, would then be diffused in its adopted home.
This announcement amazingly heartened the young brothers.</p>

<p>We now shot in a few hours through rapids and over rocks,
where, on our way up, we had toiled almost all day long. As
the sun slowly declined, the faster we raced, helter-skelter; spray
was flying, paddles thumping, the canoes, creaking and grinding
over the rocks, dashed together in a mad race to be the first to
reach Juman’s house and proclaim the glorious news that we had
put the enemy to flight. The canoe wherein I sat, was one of
the earliest to reach Bowang Takun, and I could, therefore,
count the canoes as they came darting through the dense leafy
arch where the smaller stream entered the Baram. There were
in all sixty by the count. No sooner were they drawn up on
the sloping bank, than their occupants, numbering at least six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
hundred, were one and all, dashing and splashing in the water.
[Indeed, it might be almost asserted that the Kayans and Kenyahs
live as much in the water as out of it. Although they may
have been wading alongside of their canoes all day, yet there is
never a halt of even a few minutes that they do not divest themselves
of their one garment and at least extend themselves in the
water, if it is not deep enough for swimming. It would be as
monstrous for a Kayan boy not to know how to swim as for a
white boy not to know how to run.]</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A STEALTHY APPROACH TO THE HOUSE OF AN ENEMY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After the restful bath and the cooking of the evening meal,
on the bank,—this time we were not Juman’s guests,—the expedition
began to disband. Those who lived only a short distance
up or down the river heaped their cumbersome accoutrements in
their canoes and glided off into the darkness.</p>

<p>Abun’s party had a pious duty to perform; accordingly, we
spent the night at Bowang Takun, where Abun was going to
borrow the head. The loan was transacted with minutest care;
the head was reverently lifted from its resting-place by a very
old man, whose remnant of days on earth was nearly spent,
and who, therefore, shrank less, than a younger man would
shrink, from a touch which is sure to be followed by speedy
death. From the moment that the skull was touched a deep
solemnity fell on all. No laugh, no jest, no light word broke the
reverence of what all felt to be a holy act. The skull was carefully
swathed in palm leaves and tied under the bow of Abun’s
boat, so that it just grazed the water.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning we all set out for Long Lama,
Abun’s boat in the lead, and without stopping all that day we
drifted silently down with the slow current under a scorching
sun. Abun’s canoe and one or two others pushed on a little
faster than the rest, and when at about five o’clock in the afternoon
we were distant from Long Lama only one turn of the river,
we found that they had there disembarked, and had already
prepared a wonderfully decorated and elaborate camp; there
the whole party must remain for the night, and not be even
seen by any member of Abun’s household till dawn of the next
day. All around the tent-like shelter of palm leaves were horizontal
poles resting on forked sticks, whereon were hung the
war-coats and caps, and the almost solid wall, thereby made, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
completed by the shields, which were leaned against it to fill in
any gaps. Spear-points glittered everywhere, and in front of this
hut, or shelter, there was reared an archway of sticks, whereof
the bark had been cut up in curled frills along the whole
length.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Down near the edge of the water was a pile of green
bamboo joints decorated with bands of plaited palm leaf; in these
the rice must be cooked, and not in earthen pots,—possibly an
instance of the tendency in all ceremonial rites to return to the
most primitive methods.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>[In the accompanying photograph, Madong, the second son,
is the well-built young fellow in the foreground; next to him is
a young warrior whose name, I think, is Jok; then comes Abun,
the Chief, with one hand resting on his shield; immediately on his
left is Batu, the youngest son; and in front of him the elderly
man, with close-cropped hair and upturned face, is the ‘fencing-master.’
At his feet is the pile of bamboo joints, and near them
several hampers containing rolls of palm-leaf matting, whereon
the natives sleep. In the background are the rows of war-coats
and shields. I was at a disadvantage in taking this photograph;
the light from the last rays of the setting sun was poor, and the
support for my camera was an unstable sand-bank.]</p>

<p>The taboo against visiting the house did not extend to Dr.
Hose and myself, nor to Dr. Hose’s Iban crew; none of us
belonged to the household; so we left the Kayans at their sacred
encampment, and were soon settled for the night amid all the
comforts the house of Abun could afford.</p>

TO THEIR HOUSE WITH THE BORROWED HEAD, WHICH WAS TO REMOVE THE
RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE MOURNING FOR A DEAD CHIEF.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the very first faint glimmer of dawn I was awakened by
an unusual stir throughout the house. The women and children
and the few men who were so unfortunate as to have
been obliged to remain behind, were all collecting along the
edge of the veranda below the eaves, whence they could get
a view of the river. Just at the very instant that the sun sent
its first shaft of level light down the long expanse of river we
heard coming from up-stream, a solemn, low, deep-toned chant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
or rather humming, in harmony. There were no articulate
words, only a continuous sound, in different keys, from treble
to bass, of the double vowel <i>oo</i>, as in <i>boom</i>. A minute later
the long line of canoes, lashed three abreast, slowly rounded the
turn, and drifted toward the house. The men were all standing
erect on the thwarts arrayed in all their many coloured war-clothes,
with bands of plaited palm leaves around their knees
and elbows and also on every spear and paddle. Only a few were
at the paddles, merely enough to steer the procession, while all
the others stood as motionless as statues, holding their spears
upright and the point of their shields resting at their feet. On
and on they slowly glided, propelled, it almost seemed, by this
inexpressibly solemn dirge, which was wafting this sacred skull
to a home it must for ever bless. The brilliant colours of the
war-coats flashed brighter every minute as the sun rose higher,
and lit up the framework of the wondrous pageant;—the cloudless
blue sky over-head, the myriad spangled ripples of the
glistening river beneath the dark masses of heavy foliage, suggesting,
yet hiding, the ever-mysterious jungle, the hushed, awe-stricken
group of women and children, awaiting the warriors’
return, and over all, the silence of earth and sky, broken only by
the modulated cadences of that impressive harmony. On, on, they
glided until the three foremost canoes touched the bank; then Abun
alighted and unloosed the skull, still in its coverings of palm leaves,
from the bow of his boat. In order to watch the ceremony more
narrowly, I left the veranda as the boats neared the beach, and
I shall not soon forget Abun’s solemn, absorbed demeanour.
I could not catch his eye, and, unlike his usual self, he took not
the smallest notice of my presence, nor did any of the others.
Every face wore the wrapt expression of a profoundly religious
rite. Without intermitting the chant, Abun, bearing the skull,
led the procession in single file to the up-river end of the house.
[The skull was now representing a freshly taken head, and there
was no longer any danger to those who touched it.] When they
were all gathered, still chanting, in a close group, the old ‘fencing-master’
stepped out to the front with a blow-pipe, and, looking
in the direction of the Tinjar River (still chanting), addressed a
vehement warning to the enemy, and then (still chanting) raised
the blow-pipe to his lips, and blew a dart high in the air to carry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
the message to them. The chanting instantly ceased, and all
gave a wild, exultant shout! The skull was placed upon the
ground and its wrappings broken, and on four stakes near by
were placed the bleeding fragments of a chicken which the ‘fencing-master’
had torn apart as if it were a piece of paper. Each
warrior, in turn, then advanced and gravely brandished his parang
over the skull, and, walking past the four stakes, smeared the
blood of the chicken on his knees, and addressed the spirit of
the fowl in a prayer to ‘protect him from all dangers, to impart
strength and courage, and drive out all pains and stiffness from
his bones.’ After they had passed the last stake they gave a
loud, shrill shout, leaped high in the air, and ran quickly up
the notched log into the house.</p>

<p>By this ceremony each one cast off the taboo of mourning.
When all those who had actually been on the expedition had
performed it, then followed those who had been obliged to remain
at home; and after them, the small boys, even those who were
scarcely able to walk. Everyone, without exception, must be
adorned with bands of palm-leaf strips bound round their
knees and elbows, and must be dressed in war-clothes. The
small boys, however, wore only war-caps, not decorated with
horn-bill feathers, but with the skull of a horn-bill, or the long
feathers of the Argus pheasant. Those who were too tiny to
hold a parang were carried by their fathers, and their little hands
were guided while a feeble stroke was made at the head. Between
their little lips several grains of rice, boiled in a bamboo joint,
were then put, to symbolize that they too had been in a warriors’
camp and partaken of warriors’ fare. Then they were
carried past the stakes, and smeared with the blood, while the
father uttered the prayer for them, and, in place of the leap and
manly shout, gave a bound in the air, and an explosive exclamation,
before carrying them hurriedly up to the veranda.</p>

<p>As soon as every male inmate of the house, from feeble age
to toddling infancy, had performed this rite, in a flash the charm
of the taboo was snapt! In a twinkling, every corner in the house
seemed turned into a barber’s chair. Ever since the death of
Oyang Luhat, the late Chief, no hair had been trimmed, and long
locks, so unsightly to Kayan eyes, had grown on the temples
of the exquisite youths and fastidious loungers, who, before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
taboo, figured as the ‘glass of fashion,’ as they certainly are
always the ‘mould of form.’ Turn and turn about they scraped
each other, and when the operation was finished, (which, judging
from the character of the knives, must have been a fine lesson
in the endurance of agony,) each one carefully gathered
up the hair, and, rolling it in a ball, spit vigorously on it, and
threw it as far as he could out of the veranda. I imagine this
was done with the idea of preventing any one from collecting
the hair, and thereby working a charm against the owner; or it
may be that spitting upon the hair exorcises any evil Spirit lurking
in it. I asked many a one why it was done, but the only
reply was, ‘Adat seja’—<i>merely custom</i>.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>WAR-CAPS OF RATTAN AND SPLIT BAMBOO.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>[In connection with this instance of a possible survival of
primitive religion, let me mention that in this remote region I
found an example of another well-known ancient custom:—wooden
images are fashioned in the likeness of an enemy, and
placed in the jungle; as the wooden representative decays the
original sickens and dies.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In ‘The Free Museum of Science and
Art,’ in Philadelphia, two of these images are preserved. They
represent Dr. Hose and Tama Bulan. They were made by the
Lerons after the killing of Tinggi, to be revenged on these two
arch-foes. They were discovered by a friendly native and brought
to Dr. Hose, whose image happily shows as yet no sign of decay;
from the last reports the original also was in excellent health.
See next page.]</p>

<p>Of course, it is quite unbefitting for women to go through
the rite of slashing at the head; they never go on war expeditions.
Therefore, they are freed from their mourning by being sprinkled
with water dipped from the river in the palm leaves wherewith
the head has been wrapped. Thereafter they resume their ornaments
of bead-work, their ponderous brass ear-rings, and don
fillets of gaily coloured cloth.</p>

<p>When every member of the household has been freed from
the taboo by these rites, a fragment of the skull, wrapped in palm
leaves, is attached to a long rope of bamboo twigs, and solemnly
carried to the grave of the Chief, which, in the present case,
was about half a mile down-stream. In the path which the
sons and near relatives have to take to reach the grave, a living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
chicken, with its legs tied, is placed, and on it each one, in
passing, must tread, (the poor fowl does not survive more than
two or three footfalls.) The fragment of skull, lifted on the tip
of a long bamboo pole, is hung to the edge of the ornamentation
on top of the grave. When this is finished, all that can be possibly
done to honour a dead Bornean Chief has been performed.</p>

<p>At night, the men who were away in the rice-fields, when the
war-party returned, attain their freedom by smearing with the
blood of fowls a little piece of wood cut into a brush of fine strips
at one end; this brush they fasten on the side of one of their large
basket-work fish-traps, placed on the floor of the veranda, and
against this ensanguined brush they rub their knees, before uttering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
their prayer and giving the shout and the leap which the
warriors gave outside the house. The fish-trap, on this occasion,
they call their <i>Father</i>; ‘it catches everything it sees, and is
afraid of nothing.’</p>

<p>All hours of the next day are devoted to a promiscuous
slaughter of pigs and chickens, and to the preparation of a great
feast; every one contributes a pig or a fowl, according to his
means; and on every pig’s liver the fateful omens must be
deciphered. At intervals, along the whole length of the interminable
veranda, are little enclosures wherein sit the shrewd old
Dayongs, whose exhortations, before the slaughter, are potent
with the pigs to have nice, lucky livers. As each pig, with its
legs tied, is brought and laid before the Dayong to be exhorted
and then killed, the owner pays the Dayong a small fee of a
few beads, a strip of cloth, or the blade of a parang; after this
preliminary fee-giving (a custom, not unknown elsewhere), the
owner enters the little enclosure, and, seating himself beside a
large gong, proceeds to bang it with a stick, and make as much
din as possible; all the while the Dayong lectures and exhorts
the wretched pig. The owner while beating the gong pays
absolutely no attention to the Dayong’s words, which may be
possibly etiquette, but is certainly not surprising,—not a syllable
could be audible above the deafening squealing, clattering, banging
resounding on all sides. Very likely the Dayong desires to
have his platitudes overheard by no one except by the pig, whose
attention to duty is every now and then enforced by a vigorous
thump in the side from the fist, or a dig in the ribs from the
thumb of his ghostly exhorter. When the Dayong thinks the
auspicious moment has arrived, and that the swine has caught
the drift of the exhortation, and has obligingly modified the
streakings of his liver, he plunges a knife in the animal’s throat,
catches the spouting blood in a bowl, and, before life is extinct,
rips open the paunch, and extracts the dripping liver, whereon,
in characters legible only to the Dayong, the pig had inscribed
an assured knowledge of the future. Now and then, an avaricious
Dayong will persist in reading dreadful portents on the
liver; of course, a second pig must be brought, and a second fee
paid; and so on until the Dayong is satisfied, then at once the
signs become good. On the present occasion eighty-five pigs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
and sixty fowls were sacrificed. The young boys who have been
on the expedition are made to feel that they are to be numbered
among the warriors, by being compelled, on that first evening
after their return from the head-hunt, to cook their own supper
of pork and rice, and to sleep in the veranda among the grown-up
men.</p>

<p>The pork is cut into small cubes and boiled in bamboo joints;
a very pleasant flavor is thereby imparted to the meat, if you
can shut your eyes very tight to the fingers that prepare it.</p>

<p>After the feast was cooked and served in wooden trays and
bowls, we all squatted here and there about the veranda, and
helped ourselves to the toothsome delicacies of parboiled pork
and chicken, excellent boiled rice, pulverized salted fish, and
bananas. Then dusty and musty cords were cut on many a jar
of ‘Borak,’ or sweetened rice beer, and the festive cup, either half
a cocoanut or blue pressed-glass tumbler, was passed from lip to
lip. Speeches were made, in which the invincible bravery of every
warrior was proclaimed, and frightful threats were hinted as to the
fate of the Lerons, had they not fled like the cowards that they
are. Festival songs and war-dances, with kaluri accompaniment,
followed. When the jars of Borak were drained to the dregs, one
by one the exhausted warriors crept to bed, saturated with the
serene joy of duty done, glory gained, and honour paid to their
departed Chief.</p>

<p>Even after all these ceremonies and the feast, the house is not
utterly free from taboo: for ten days no work may be done in
the clearings, nor may the men go for rattans or any jungle
product. There is always a foundation of wisdom for these
taboos. Thus, to keep the men collected in or near the house
for a number of days, after a head-hunting raid, is a wise provision:
the house cannot be surprised unawares by a retaliating
force.</p>

<p>Thus ended this memorable War Expedition of the Kayans
and Kenyahs of the Baram against the Lerons of the Tinjar, to
vindicate Juman for the legal killing of Tinggi and drive the
Lerons back to their own district,—a typical expedition, save
alone that the Omen Birds were not consulted, and that it did
not end in a wild and wanton raid on innocent people.</p>

</div>

<p>During the rainy months, when all work in the fields is
suspended, and Nature herself attends to the rice, every path in
the jungle leads idle feet to mischief, and, if war be forbidden
by the Prenta, pent-up energy may find a wild outlet in boisterous
protestations of peace, provided only that these protestations
have at least a suggestion of war.</p>

<p>After our war expedition up the Baram just narrated, barely a
fortnight elapsed before we were organizing a great Peace-making
with those very people of the Tinjar who had been our foes.
Tama Bulan, Tama Usong, Aban Deng, and Juman, the chiefest
Chiefs of the Kayans and Kenyahs, with all their numerous
warriors, were eager to join in the Peace-making, and pledge
themselves to the Tinjar people for the friendliness of all the
dwellers on the Baram and its tributaries.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Baram Chiefs were summoned to the Fort,
and the day before this great army of peace-makers set out, Dr.
Hose invited these Chiefs and their adherents to a lavish feast at
his house. The viands were prepared according to the taste of
the guests, and, to make all feel perfectly at home, served on the
floor of the veranda; the arrack, however, was of extra Chinese
brew, and, of course, superior and very much stronger than the
diluted, home-brewed liquor to which they were accustomed.
Consequently, the hilarity and fluency of song and speech, upon
a liberal and well-laid foundation of boiled pork, chicken, rice,
and salted fish, was exuberant, but never boisterous. Perhaps
the presence of so many powerful Chiefs, above all, that of the
all-powerful Resident, had a restraining influence. We all sat
down (should I not say, squatted?) at about four in the afternoon,
and the last of the guests departed to their quarters in the Bazaar
at about eleven o’clock at night. About fifteen pounds of tobacco
were consumed, three good-sized pigs were stowed away, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
Chinese shop-keepers alone know how many jars of arrack were
unsealed. Tama Bulan and Tama Usong were the last to leave
the scene of revelry, and we watched (I must admit with great
relief) their dusky figures disappear down the path, as, linked
arm in arm, they meandered off in the broad moonlight toward
the Bazaar.</p>

<p>Juman, for the second time the important member of an
expedition, failed to appear, and since it was partly on his account
that the trouble between the people of the two rivers had arisen,
the Peace-making would be incomplete without him. In Borneo,
after past wrongs, peace and good-fellowship cannot be gained
by simple asseverations; there must be always a palpable
exchange of beads, highly prized jars, brass gongs, etc., as an
indemnity. The perpetrator of the wrong, or one of his descendants,
must be present with his adherents to join in the sham fight,
known as the ‘Jawa.’ The canoes of the peace-party were laden
accordingly with articles for exchange, and with the paraphernalia
of the men who were to engage in the sham fight.</p>

<p>At an early hour on the morning after the feast, we started
up-river in the Government’s steam launch, for which the river
is navigable for at least sixty miles above the Fort; behind us
trailed the long line of canoes with the peace-makers,—a pretty
woe-begone, head-achey looking lot, after the Chinese arrack of
the night before. As the day wore on and we steamed slowly up
against the strong current, dodging the ponderous logs that
swept past, one by one the Chiefs climbed up from their canoes
and sat limp and taciturn around us on the small deck of
the steamer. Still no sign of Juman and his party. We had
expected to meet him before we turned off into the Tinjar River.
So necessary a personage could not be left behind; therefore, a
letter was left for him at the mouth of the Tinjar. On a large
sheet of paper, we painted a picture of a steam boat heading up-stream
with inky volumes of smoke issuing from the funnel and
a long line of canoes in tow; underneath was a gigantic hand
pointing up-stream. This letter was fastened in a cleft pole stuck
up on the bank; then we steamed at full speed up the large
tributary.</p>

HOUSE WITH FEVER AND TRYING TO LURE THE SOUL OUT OF HIS BODY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A lovely feature peculiar to the Tinjar River is the hills cultivated
with rice. On the lower reaches of the Baram, the flat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
swampy ground extends for a mile or more from the river on
both sides. Here, clearings extend over low undulating hills,
and at this season of the year the rice was already six inches
tall, and its tender emerald green was unspeakably refreshing
after the dark foliage of the jungle. Twice we passed groups
of men and women busily weeding the fields; but, poor wretches,
as if their toil were not enough, they must all needs be clad in
heavy war-cloaks; they had heard, so they said, that there was
an enormous head-hunting army on the way from the Baram, and
they were in hourly terror of being attacked and killed. We
allayed their fears, and were delighted to learn that the fame of
our War Expedition had travelled so bravely and had lost nothing
in transmission.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon we reached the household of the
Lelaks, and halted for the night, to allow Juman to catch up
with us. The old man of the house, whose adherents were not
numerous enough to entitle him to the rank of a ‘Penghulu,’ and
whose wealth was insufficient for the title of ‘Orang Kaya’ (<i>Rich
Man</i>), merely presided over his household by reason of his age,
and was known simply as the ‘Orang Tuah’ (<i>Old Man</i>). On
our arrival, we were told that he was almost at death’s door
from an attack of fever, and that every resource known to
Dayong art had been tried in vain; evidently, the evil Spirits
had resolved to entice his soul away, in spite of the elaborate
barrier which the Dayongs had professionally erected in front
of his house.</p>

<p>This barrier consisted of a circle of stakes cut, at intervals
down their sides, into curled shavings; in the centre of
the circle stood a high, squared pole painted with stripes of red
and black; at about four feet from the ground, and again near
its top, were cross-bars piercing it from front to back and from
side to side. At its base stood an earthen jar filled with water,
and round about outside the circle was a bristling thicket or sort
of <i>chevaux de frise</i> of posts and stakes cut into manifold fringes
of shavings, and several cleft sticks about three feet high, holding
in the cleft an egg. To the Dayongs, these curled shavings
and cleft sticks have a profound meaning which they either did
not know or did not wish to divulge. All these prophylactics were,
however, in vain; the evil Spirits obstinately and perversely refused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
to depart from the old man. Not being an angel, I pressed
fearlessly within this charmed ground, and even took photographs
there in spite of Tama Bulan’s solemn warning. He would not
go near the barrier, and in awed tones warned me that just as sure
as I touched any of those stakes I would have horrid dreams
and most assuredly be clutched by a ghost and hideously scarred
for life; should the ghost chance to clutch me by the throat, I
would choke to death and never wake.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>After I had taken the photograph, we paid a visit to the old
man as he lay feverishly tossing and turning on his hard board
bed. I administered to him a placebo in the form of an assurance
that I had skilfully caught and imprisoned the evil Spirits
in my ‘box-with-an-eye’ (<i>my camera</i>), and they would trouble
him no more; then, abandoning the ‘faith cure,’ I administered
a generous dose of quinine.</p>

<p>The Lelaks are an unusually industrious household; they cultivate
an abundance of rice and keep it stored for rainy days, in
granaries which, although they are far away from their dwellings
and hidden in the jungle, they decorate with graceful designs in
black paint upon a white ground. In their houses, also, almost
every beam-end is carved into barbaric figures of men or of
monkeys in twisted positions with arms and legs interlacing;
also many of the upright posts supporting the roof have carved
in them deep niches to serve as seats.</p>

<p>In the evening, under the benign effects of a hearty meal of
rice and fish and of numerous cigarettes, Tama Bulan became
jovial, and his broad, genial smile beamed to right and left on
all as he sat with his back against one of the carved house-posts,
and proposed that we the guests should be entertained with some
of the dances for which the Lelak women are famous. Of course,
the women were coquettishly shy at first and scurried off to their
rooms. Tama Bulan was not, however, to be thus put off or put
down, but appealed to the Orang Tuah to send searching parties
for the best dancers. Then he turned to Dr. Hose, and, in a
metaphor of which he was fond, said, chuckling, ‘Tuan, this
fishing doesn’t seem to be very successful; all the good, plump
fish have gone up-stream, and left us nothing but these bony
ones;’ here he nodded toward some old and thin beldames,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
calling them by the names of the poorer kinds of fish which
generally are thrown away; but when, a few moments later,
three young girls, dressed in their best skirts and with bright-coloured
fillets round their heads, shuffled coyly out from their
rooms ready for the dance, he lit a fresh cigarette and settled
back comfortably in his seat, saying, ‘Aha! Here are plump fish
worth looking at.’</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus44" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus44.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>DECORATED STORE HOUSE FOR RICE.</p>

<p>THE PLANT GROWING DENSELY AROUND IT, IS WILD TAPIOCA.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The dance was like that of almost all of the Malay and allied
races, more waving of the arms and swaying of the body than
movements of the feet. It was exceedingly like the dances of the
Javanese, wherein movements of hands and wrists are the chief
features. It appeared to be a solemn performance; instead of
the fixed, mechanical smile of our ballet dancers, there was a
stare of constrained solemnity verging on a scowl.</p>

<p>The effect on the dancers themselves was marked; demure
as were their motions, their excitement was great. One of them
suddenly ceased and, leaning against the wall, declared that she
was exhausted with the strain. Although the movements of the
dance had been slow and gentle, she was undeniably almost
in an ecstatic trance, with eyes half closed and breathing
labored.</p>

<p>Very different were the Kayan dances which followed; the
men vied with each other in wild leaps and shouts, springing
high in the air and coming down on their knees, all the while
battling with imaginary foes; slashing with their parang and
waving their shield in rhythmical time to the drone of the
kaluri.</p>

<p>Our hand-clapping by way of applause caused great laughter
and astonishment, and the ever-present small boys imitated it in
high glee. Their only fashion of showing approval or wonder
is by a loud cluck with the tongue. Once on a time, when we
happened to stop at a house which, during the selection of a
rice-field, was under a ‘lali’ or <i>restriction</i>, (no stranger may then
enter and no inmate leave it,) Dr. Hiller and myself were urgently
requested to pace up and down in front of the house, after we
had stripped ourselves to the waist, so that the inmates might
have the privilege of seeing our Japanese tattooing. They had
all gathered in a row behind the railing of the veranda, and as
we passed along below, the succession of explosive clucks of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
unbounded admiration sounded like musketry in the distance.
Eagerness to see our tattooing broke down for us many a barrier.
Although the Borneans themselves are masters in the art, nevertheless
they use but one colour, and could not believe that the
variegated Japanese designs were not painted, instead of pricked
in. Many a time this incredulity proved a sore trial, by subjecting
us to vigorous attempts at rubbing off the colour with a dirty
thumb, well moistened on the tongue. Here also at the Lelak
house, at Tama Bulan’s urgent request, I stripped to the waist,
and the sight of Hori Chiyo’s best handiwork on my back so
inspired one elderly woman, that, after the chorus of clucks had
subsided, she burst into song, which, being in the Lelak dialect,
I was unable to understand, but was assured it was extremely
complimentary.</p>

<p>The guest chambers in a Lelak house are boxes about five
feet square, suspended from the roof, and to which access can
be gained only by a ladder. Possibly, this is for the comfort of
the guest; possibly, it is in order that he may not have too much
liberty. We preferred, however, the floor of the veranda, but
before morning I realized the error; three times was I awakened
by an incubus of a dog curling himself up for sleep on my
chest.</p>

<p>Late in the night, the whole house was aroused by the arrival
of Juman and his adherents; he had read our letter and made
the best time he could against the strong current. The expedition
was now complete, and the following morning we abandoned
the steamer and started off in canoes.</p>

<p>The Orang Tuah of the Lelaks maintained that my box-with-one-eye
was better than all the Dayongs, and that of a surety I
had effectively captured the evil Spirits; he was so much better
that he insisted on going along with us. I must acknowledge
I was none too well pleased with his determination; he was exceedingly
feeble, and should he die the blame would be surely
imputed to me.</p>

<p>Continuously along our route the numbers of the peace-makers
were augmented by boat-loads from the houses that we
passed, all anxious to join in the feasting which took place
wherever we halted, and all wanted to be present at the final
grand ratification in the house of Tama Aping Buling at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
head-waters, where Kilup and Juman, bitter enemies, were to
meet, and be reconciled.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon during a terrific thunder-storm, we
arrived at Tama Liri’s house, and although he is a Penghulu of
importance, his house is a disgrace and he himself a troublesome
thorn to the Sarawak Government. In the first place, there was
no notched log whereby to cross the wide stretch of muddy
bank; to get to the house we should have been compelled to
wade through mud knee-deep, had not the Kayans and Kenyahs
in our party devoted themselves energetically to showing the
Berawans what could be done in the way of rapid work. In
pelting sheets of rain and deafening peals of thunder they
dragged forth a great fallen tree-trunk and cut notches in it.
The Chief and his people, meanwhile, who ought to have been
helping, sat at their ease up in the house and looked down unconcernedly.
In the second place, Tama Liri’s house is built upon
such ramshackle poles that they could not support the weight of
boards, and, consequently, the flooring is of bamboo strips, and in
places so weak that all were afraid that the whole flimsy structure
would tumble about their ears. The Baram folk were by no
means in a good temper when at last they gained the shelter of
Tama Liri’s veranda. In the evening all the Chiefs took a malicious
pleasure in telling their host what a miserable shanty he
had instead of a house, and expressing the hope that by the time
they revisited him he would have built a new one. In the midst
of these vivacious observations, which did not seem, in the least,
to disturb our stolid host, Tama Usong begged me to lend him
my box of matches; on receiving it he passed it over to Tama
Liri with the suave remark, ‘Here, Blood-brother, are some
posts for your house; they are better than those you have, and
you can buy more in the Bazaar, very cheap.’ All the Baram
people, and even some of Tama Liri’s own followers, snorted and
laughed at this stroke of wit, but the host adroitly diverted their
thoughts by instantly expatiating on the pig, six spans long!
which Aban Liah (not he himself, but his neighbor Aban Liah)
was going to kill for the feast when we arrived at his house.
Tama Liri added that it would have been better, of course, if it
were eight spans long; this would have been the kind <i>he</i> would
kill were <i>he</i> giving a feast. Tama Bulan was not in as good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
spirits as on the preceding evening. He was depressed by the
illness of his nephew, Wan, who had been ailing ever since reaching
the Baram Fort, and now, from exposure in the heavy rain
during an attack of fever, was in the first stage of pneumonia and
verging on delirium. Tama Bulan begged me to give him some
medicine; but remembering the disagreeable time that I had in his
own house, in consequence of the death of an inmate, I demurred,
preferring to shift the responsibility on the Dayongs and the
livers of pigs and entrails of chickens.</p>

<p>Tama Bulan assured me, however, that he had absolute confidence
in my medicine, and always had, even at the time of
Lueng’s death, when her brother, who thought we had poisoned
her, wanted to kill Dr. Hiller and myself. ‘Besides,’ he added,
‘it will be so inconvenient to have Wan die in the house of Tama
Liri; of all men, he will be the very one to demand immense
compensation for the ill-luck brought on his miserable old
house.’ Thereupon, I did all in my power for the boy; but in
the morning, when the time came to leave, he was only a very
little better, and it would have been highly dangerous to move him
down to the boats. With great regret we were obliged to leave
behind the dear old Kenyah Chief to take care of his good-for-nothing
nephew. We had depended upon Tama Bulan to make
the peace-ceremonies go off smoothly, and in strict adherence to
Borneo customs. Wan’s father, a half-brother of Tama Bulan,
was continually making trouble between the Kenyahs and the
Sarawak Government, until Dr. Hose one day obtained possession
of an invaluable charm of his, consisting of a small misshapen
hen’s egg, whereon he based all his good luck. Only by the
ever-present threat that his egg would be broken by Dr.
Hose at the least sign of treason on his part, can he be controlled
and kept peaceable, even, I believe, to this hour. Owing
to the sins of the father, I was not quite so compassionate as I
might have been, for this handsome but arrogant youth, who
was now the cause of our losing the assistance of Tama Bulan.
I left my watch with the dutiful old uncle, and exact diagrams
of the positions of its hands when the medicines were to be
given. Our next stage was to be but a short one: if Wan
were better on the following day, Tama Bulan could catch up
with us; if he were worse, my advice was that he should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
moved to the boats carefully and an attempt made to get him
home. Tama Bulan said he would much rather have him die in
the canoe than in Tama Liri’s house. Judging by the general
lack of recuperative power in the Borneo people when they are
seriously ill, and by the small probability that my instructions
would be strictly obeyed, I thought Wan was doomed, and so
expressed myself to Tama Bulan, with the hope, at the same time,
that the medicine would be efficacious.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>RIVER BANK IN FRONT OF A LONG-HOUSE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Joined by Tama Liri and a number of his adherents, we set
out for the house of Aban Avit; Tama Bulan dolefully and regretfully
bade us good-bye, wishing us ‘Salamat jalan’—<i>a lucky
journey</i>.</p>

<p>Aban Avit, also a Berawan, proved to be as much a credit to
the tribe as Tama Liri is a disgrace; his house is strongly built,
well floored, well roofed with iron-wood shingles, decorated here
and there with carvings, and, around doors and along partition
walls, ornamented with borders of loops and circles and dots
painted in black and white by the Chief’s own hand. (Elsewhere
I have described the house with some minuteness.)</p>

<p>No longer under Tama Bulan’s influence, the other Kayan
Chiefs began to behave in a foolish and stubborn manner.</p>

<p>Tama Usong flatly refused to come up to the house because
he disliked Aban Avit, and sulked in his boat on the other side
of the river, preferring to endure torrents of rain at night
rather than forget old scores until the very hour of the grand
ratification of peace and amity at Tama Aping Buling’s. His
absence, however, was not felt; the house was full of strangers;
an old, sad-faced Chief, named Laki Jok Orong, had arrived only
the day before, from the Rejang, and was on his way to the
Baram, whither he was escorting a middle-aged woman who
three years previously had been abducted from her home, and
ever since held captive in a Rejang River house. Curiously
enough, Dr. Kükenthal, on a visit to the lower Baram, had happened
to photograph this very woman before her abduction,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and
had sent a copy of the portrait to her family. Having discovered
the house wherein the woman was detained, some of her friends
set out to obtain her release. By means of this photograph,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
which they took with them, they were enabled to establish her
identity beyond dispute, and brought her away. The features
in the photograph were still recognisable, even under a thick
coating of finger-marks. The woman herself now had possession
of it, and, proudly unwrapping it from its many coverings of dirty
cotton cloth and dried palm leaves, passed it round the circle.</p>

<p>Laki Jok Orong had a sad tale to tell of the oppression of
his people by one Owang Taha, a half-breed Malay, and a sub-Resident
for the Government, in the upper Rejang River. When
he once got fairly started, he kept up the screed in a whining,
lugubrious monotone that droned on and on till his audience, by
desertions and by new arrivals, was changed several times, and at
last engaged in general conversation; but none the less, the
droning plaint of the Rejang Chief still went on and on. The
seven or eight long, straggling hairs which he suffered to grow
on his lip, above the right corner of his mouth waggled and
waved, and in his ears the ornaments, carved out of a horn-bill’s
crest to represent tiger-cat’s teeth, alternately pointed up and
down as he dolefully shook his head over the never-ending
rehearsal of his wrongs. I retired to my dark-tent, developed a
dozen or more negatives, packed away all my trays and chemicals,
and then when I rejoined the circle around the fire in the
veranda, still from the outer edge of darkness quavered Jok
Orong’s voice as persistent as ever,—and as unheeded.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus46" style="max-width: 43.75em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>SOME CANOES OF THE PEACE-PARTY IN A QUIET REACH
BETWEEN RAPIDS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Early in the next forenoon, Tama Bulan and six of his best
paddlers came swiftly up-stream to tell us that Wan was much
better, but that they had decided to take him home with all speed.
Of course, that Tama Bulan should turn round and immediately
go back to Tama Liri’s was not for a moment to be thought of,
and, although it was early in the day, jars of arrack were
brought out, and the sullen Tama Usong and Juman, persuaded
thereto by Tama Bulan, joined us in the veranda, and the
unwearied Laki Jok Orong seized a fresh opportunity to indulge
in the luxury of woe, and to begin, and continue the recital of
innumerable wrongs. The etiquette in drinking toasts is the
reverse of ours; with us, he who is toasted remains seated,
generally with a sickly, self-conscious smile, while all the others
rise and drink to him. In Borneo, however, the toast is the only
one who rises and is the only one to drink, and he must leave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
no heel-taps; it is the company who remain seated, and break
into a deafening humming and <i>oo-oo</i>-ing, which are kept up
until the last drop is drained. Possibly, the custom arises from
the fact that there are rarely cups enough to go round, and one
sticky, begrimed, glass tumbler, or else a carved bamboo cup,
(rarely used now-a-days,) must perforce pass from lip to lip.
That there had been such things as bamboo drinking-cups, we
discovered by mere accident from a song, commonly sung at
these feasts, which runs:—‘I offer to you the glittering cup, I offer
to you the bamboo cup.’ The words have a jingling rhythm:—</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>‘Tebok Bulu,’—Bamboo Drinking-cup.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Never having seen in use, as cups, aught else but pressed-glass
tumblers or cocoanut shells, we asked what was meant by
‘tebok bulu’ and, by way of answer, a rummage began among
the old mats and baskets piled on the rafters; whereupon,
several bamboo cups were found, coated with dust and soot.
They were carved into a sort of lip like a pitcher on the
upper edge, and on the sides were decorated with engraved
scrolls, bands, and circles. Tama Bulan was delighted to see them,
and said he remembered well when there was no other kind of
cup than the tebok bulu. He insisted that one should be
washed out immediately and put to use, inasmuch as arrack
always tasted far better from the bamboo. To Jok Orong, being
a guest from afar, was accorded the honor of the first drink, and
the <i>oo-oo</i>-ing was so thunderous that in his nervousness most of
the arrack trickled down where his shirt front might have been.
Then came Tama Bulan’s turn, and without the wink of an
eyelid he drained the cup, and then gave a cleanly wipe round his
mouth with the long, dangling end of his waist-cloth. So the
flowing bowl passed round; one after another the Chiefs were
toasted and <i>oo-oo</i>-ed, and Jok Orong’s perpetual-motion tongue
was again set free, but instead of recapitulating his endless
wrongs, he now divulged, for the first time, the true object of his
visit. Having first privately conferred with Tama Bulan and
obtained the latter’s hearty approval of his purpose, he formally
announced to the whole company that he was on his way to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
Baram Fort to convey to Dr. Hose, whom he now unexpectedly
met on the road, the earnest wishes of the people of the Batang
Kayan River, in Dutch Borneo, to emigrate to the Baram district,
and place themselves under the protecting Government of Rajah
Brooke. It was the very thing that Dr. Hose had been hoping
to hear for some time past. It was especially fortunate that Tama
Bulan happened to be on hand, and could give his weighty
assurances that the immigrants would meet with cordial welcome.
As a tangible proof of the friendship of the Kayans and Kenyahs
of the Baram, a large bundle of presents was made up for Jok
Orong to carry back with him. Tama Bulan purchased at once
from Aban Avit two large brass gongs as his contribution, (a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
really lavish present;) Aban Avit sent a highly prized clay jar;
Tama Usong and Juman contributed parangs and spear-heads,
and Dr. Hose sent a bolt of white cotton cloth, three bolts
of Turkey red, a bottle of Scotch whiskey, and, with his usual
happy tact, a bundle of candles; these, he explained to Jok
Orong, were to light the footsteps of the new comers and
guide them to a land of ease and plenty,—a gift and a message
exactly in accord with their own sentimental symbolism; and six
months later, when a large number of these Batang Kayan people
did move over to the Baram, the Chiefs all came to Dr. Hose
and laid these candles before him in the court-room of the Fort.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>RIVER SCENE IN THE HEART OF BORNEO.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When the arrack was getting low and the lament of Jok
Orong was beginning afresh, Tama Bulan arose to take his leave.
All the people of the house, even the women and children,
marched out in single file and took their places on the plank
walk leading to the river-bank, and even on the notched log at
the very edge of the water. As the brave old Kenyan Chief’s
canoe swung out, all those who stood on the shore waved their
large disc-like hats, shouting farewells and wishes for his safe
journey home. He leaned far out from under the palm-leaf
screen of his canoe, and with a broad smile, revealing a gleam
of his shining black teeth, waved his hat and shouted success
to the Great Peace-party; the swift current caught his boat, and
it dashed out of sight round the turn of the river. There is
unquestionably an unusual personal force in this middle-aged
Kenyah Chief’s character; not a tribe that does not respect his
name and speak of him with admiration mingled almost with
reverence. In my book of photographs, which I carried about
with me to overcome the objections of timid souls to having their
portraits taken, Tama Bulan’s portrait soon became framed with
a black margin of thumb-marks, and his features much dimmed
by constant fingering,—the natives are never content simply to
look at a portrait, but always insist on passing their hands over
it; in landscapes, no matter how familiar the scene, they take no
interest whatever. Tama Bulan’s influence cannot be attributed
to fierce looks; his expression is, on the contrary, gentle and
benign; nor is his presence commanding, but yet, when he once
gives an order or pronounces judgement, there seems to be no
thought of disobedience or of appeal. Certainly, he has one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
characteristic: keenness; we once asked him if he knew what
was meant when, in talking English among ourselves, we said
‘T. B.’ (his initials); he at once replied, ‘I think, Tuan, you are,
probably, talking about me.’ We were led to ask because we
noticed several times that he looked up swiftly when these initials
were uttered.</p>

<p>By the time that all the arrack had been quaffed, the promiscuous
household of Aban Avit was somewhat demoralized;
nevertheless, we picked out a party of eight or ten sober men to
escort us to the top of an adjoining hill, whence we could get the
bearings of several mountains which would give us cross-bearings
when we reached the really hilly country. It was an exceedingly
difficult ascent, although the hill was only five hundred feet
high; so dense was the jungle with thorny palms, rattans, and
the roots of ‘buttress trees,’ that we had to cut every step of our
way to the top. When we reached the summit we were just
as much closed in by trees as when we were at the foot. As a
sight of the horizon was essential, there was no help for it but
to sacrifice some of the grand old trees; so our men were set to
work with their axes, and in a few minutes one after another
of the venerable giants went toppling down the precipitous hillside,
carrying smaller trees in their fall and making a crashing
roar that reverberated from mountain to mountain like veritable
peals of thunder. Then were disclosed views of the surrounding
mountains through the open windows in the foliage, and we
were enabled to take the bearings of Mt. Dulit, and Mt. Mulu,
and the peaks of a low range of lime-stone hills that were to
the south-westward near the coast.</p>

<p>The next day, during our toilsome paddling up-river, we overtook
an old Chief named Jamma and his party, also on the way
to Tama Aping Buling’s to participate in the Peace ceremonies.</p>

<p>Jamma had the reputation of having at all times a marvellously
good opinion of himself, and on this occasion was travelling
in grand state with gong-players in the bow of his boat
discoursing that tinkling, staccato music, of which, it seems, he
was an ardent admirer.</p>

</figure>

<p>The instrument known as the ‘Kromong’ is an importation
from Brunei, the ancient capital of Borneo, and consists of a
series of eleven small brass gongs laid on ropes of rice straw and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
struck with a wooden beater. The result is perfect in time but
absolutely devoid of melody; it is merely running up and down
the imperfect scale of gongs in sequence, or beginning at the
deepest toned, or largest gong, with the left hand, the third
in the series is struck with the right hand, then the second
with the left and the fourth with the right, and so up the line
of all the eleven gongs, the left hand following the right at an
interval of one gong. At a distance, possibly at a very great distance,
the sound wafted across the water is really not unpleasant,
recalling the gurgling and tinkling of a woodland brook; but close
at hand its jangling monotony is beyond words exasperating.</p>

<p>Jamma, to whom was due this running accompaniment, is the
nephew of the redoubtable Aban Jau, who, in the wild days
before Sir Charles Brooke became Rajah of the Baram district,
was the ruler over all the people of the Tinjar. For years he
defied the Sarawak Government, and with his numerous and
formidable household of eight hundred people was the terror of
the whole region. His house was over a quarter of a mile in
length, and was well stocked with brass swivel-guns brought
from Brunei. But he was finally overpowered by the Rajah’s
trained Iban soldiers and forced to submit to the laws and the
taxes of Sarawak. Mild and moderate as these were, they were
too galling to Aban Jau, and he soon after migrated to the
regions of ‘Bulun Matai,’—the Land of the Dead,—his household
was scattered, and nothing now remains of his long-house
except rows of decaying posts stretching far away into a thick,
impenetrable overgrowth of palms, gigantic ferns, and tangled
vines. To judge of the dead uncle by the living nephew, it
cannot be said that the breed is improved; the nephew, Jamma,
is a decidedly repulsive old fellow in spite of his musical strain.
At the time I made his acquaintance he was sadly in need of a
razor, or rather, of a pair of tweezers; a five days’ scraggly
growth of grizzled bristles covered his chin and cheeks; to aid
his failing eyes he wore a pair of huge, circular, brass-rimmed
spectacles, evidently a bargain, purchased at random from a
Chinese trader; their focus did not in the least comply with the
formula of his eye-sight, and made him squinny up his eyes in a
number of wrinkles that would puzzle Cocker. The eyes behind
the glasses resembled those of an Orang Utan; the whites were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
a dirty, blood-shot brown, and the iris appeared to have overrun
and left a stain around it. His eyebrows and eyelashes had been
pulled out, and beneath the lower lids hung wrinkled and flabby
bags of skin. His upper lip was long, and came down to a point
in the middle, and his lower lip was thick and everted, exposing
the pale, moist, inner surface. His nose was broad and flat, and
the nostrils opened directly forward and apparently into the cavities
of his skull. On his head a thin, unhealthy-looking crop of
whitish hair stood up, like a scrubbing-brush, where it was not
covered by the very dirty and faded blue and white jockey cap
of canton flannel, which he wore with unmeasured pride and with
a ‘peace in the consciousness of being well dressed,’ which all
his ‘religion could not bestow.’ The stretched lobe of his right
ear had given way, and one long end dangled down on his chest
and whipped from side to side whenever he moved his head
quickly. Long experience has taught me utterly to distrust personal
appearance at first sight, but in Jamma’s case a prolonged
acquaintance confirmed a belief that his intense ugliness had
struck in.</p>

<p>The Peace-party was by this time assuming large proportions;
constant additions were made to it from the houses along
the river, and late in the afternoon, after a vigorous and inevitable
outburst from Jamma’s gongs, we pulled up at the high
sandy bank in front of the house of Tama Aping Pang. Here,
beyond the region of mosquitoes, and while darkness was closing
in, cooking fires were built along the shore.</p>

<p>After the evening meal was finished and universal benevolence
was diffused by soothing cigarettes, all the Kayans went up
into the house to assist Juman in the rite of ‘Usut’—that is,
of obliterating a feud. The interchange of Usut is obligatory
between the descendants of enemies whenever they first enter
each other’s houses; they may have met many times on most
friendly terms in the jungle or in the houses of neighbours, but
they must not take shelter under one another’s roof until they
have appeased the wrongs done by and against their ancestors.
The simple rite of giving Usut for ancestral wrongs is expanded
into the performance of Jawa when, in addition, the descendants
have been themselves wrongdoers.</p>

<p>Up the notched log we all mounted to the veranda and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
seated ourselves in a circle on the floor. Juman and Tama
Aping Pang, a short and squat little man, with a decidedly Mongolian
face, sat cross-legged and facing each other. Juman
began the ceremony by flinging down a roughly made iron
spear-head into the centre of the circle; thereupon Jamma,
still wearing his goggles and his blue and white jockey cap,
arose to officiate. Upon the flat surface of the spear-head a
young chicken was at once decapitated, then torn to pieces, and
its warm blood smeared thickly over the point. The hideous
Jamma thereupon proclaimed, in the guttural grunts of the Sibop
language, that all enmity between the Houses of Tama Aping
Pang and Juman was at an end, and hereafter neither of them
could be reproached with having allowed the slaughter of
their ancestors to go unavenged. Whereupon sundry beads
and trinkets were exchanged more as a formality than on
account of their value, and some blood from the spear-point
having been rubbed either on the chest or arms of everyone
present, including ourselves, Juman and all his clan at once
hailed Tama Aping Pang and all his clan, as friends. No
carousing followed, and the weary Kayans soon retired to the
river-bank and to their canoes to sleep.</p>

<p>This house of Tama Aping Pang is famed for its manufacture
of ‘Sumpits,’ or blow-pipes. All along on the partition wall of
the veranda, I noticed that they were stacked in all stages of
manufacture, from the rough-hewn and thick staves up to the
drilled and polished tubes. The best Sumpits are made of a
hard, close-grained, reddish wood of a tree called ‘Niagang.’
This is used not only on account of its hardness but also
because it is exceedingly straight and has very few knots. A
staff of wood about eight feet long is shaved down until it is
about three and a half inches in diameter; it is then inserted in a
hole in the floor of the house, and so secured that one end
remains five or six inches above the floor; over it a man stands
with a long, slender rod of iron flattened to a rough edge at one
end; this edge an assistant keeps constantly true to the centre
of the long staff, while the man raises and drops the drill perpendicularly.
Gradually a bore of about a quarter of an inch in
diameter is thus produced. It is an exceedingly slow process; it
takes at least eight or nine hours to drill through the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
length of the staff. The bore is now smoothed, first, by means
of fine sand or clay smeared on a slim rattan, which is pulled
through it many times rapidly backward and forward. It is
then ready for polishing with another piece of rattan ending in a
loop or a cleft, wherein leaves, like the bamboo, rich in silica,
are bound; it is thus polished until it shines almost as brilliantly
as a gun-barrel. The staff is now trimmed down to the diameter
of about an inch and a half at the mouth, and to an inch at the
muzzle, and then scraped and smoothed with knives and shark-skin
files. If the tube happen to be slightly sprung, the curve is
overcome by a broad iron spear-head bound on at the muzzle;
when the pipe is held horizontally the weight of the iron counteracts
the curve.</p>

<p>Some of the more highly finished blow-pipes are furnished
with a sight, called by the Kayans ‘Bitan,’ ingeniously made of
a cowrie shell imbedded in gutta-percha near the muzzle, with
the slit-like opening turned upward and parallel with the shaft;
again, others have an iron sight, near the muzzle, bound on with
rattan. I have never seen any carved ornamentation on a blow-pipe
except a plate of bone inlaid with strips of lead, at the
mouth-end. ‘Sumpitan’ is the Malay name for the weapon; the
Kayans call it ‘Leput,’ and the Punans simply ‘Put;’ Ibans,
who clip and elide Malay words, drop the ending <i>an</i>, and call
it ‘Sumpit.’ All these names are, possibly, derived from an
imitation of the sound when the dart is blown through the tube
and the tongue closes the opening with a quick pat.</p>

<p>Before our departure next morning there was lively trading in
the specialty of the house. The house itself was really a notable
monument of industry and artistic taste; many of the projecting
beam-ends were carved and the partition walls decorated with
borders and frescoes in black and red. For a bolt of red cloth I
bought the elaborately carved door of a dwelling-room, whereof
the photograph is on the opposite page.</p>

<p>Our next destination was the house of the crafty and treacherous
Aban Liah, once a respected Penghulu, but on account of
his duplicity in connection with the murder of the Chinaman by
Tinggi, (set forth in the preceding pages,) the Government had
degraded him. His house was selected, nevertheless, as a rendezvous
for the whole Peace-party before ascending the river to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
house of Tama Aping Billing, just then the candidate for the
Penghulu-ship of the upper Tinjar, and also for Aban Liah’s
seat in the Council Negri.</p>

<p>After the halt for luncheon, at mid-day, old Jamma courteously
invited me into his boat, and in order to overcome my
prejudice against him I accepted his invitation. He verily tried
his best to make me comfortable; arranged mats and rolls of
cloth for me to recline on; started up the gong-beater to his
deafening and lugubrious work; told me with assiduous attention
the names of the small tributary streams which we passed, and
zealously pointed out one where some of his men had gone on a
collecting trip for the ‘thing that smells,’—a circumlocution for
camphor,—he was afraid to pronounce the name lest it bring bad
luck to his collectors. That the river was pre-empted was manifest;
across its mouth had been stretched a rope of rattan, and
from it dangled wooden models of parangs, billiongs, (axes) and
spears. These models indicated that the river was claimed by
the camphor collectors; to disregard this warning exposed the
offender to the malignity of all evil Spirits. The only way
whereby such a taboo may be counteracted is to build a fire, and
erect over it an arch of twigs and sticks cut at the ends and down
the sides into curled shavings; when the fire burns up briskly,
he who would break the taboo must carefully explain to the fire
that he is a near friend to the claimants of the river, and entreat
the flame and the smoke to convey his message of good-will both
to them and to the Spirits of the jungle. After this ceremony he
may, in perfect safety, pass under the rattan, and ascend the river.</p>

<p>In the course of this entertaining and instructive conversation,
Jamma suddenly, and apparently for the first time, caught sight
of my briar-wood pipe, and, apropos of nothing, exclaimed,
‘What a pity it is that the Tuan did not bring with him several
pipes like the one he is now smoking.’ The mystery of his
devotion to me was at once solved! Here was the secret of his
hospitality; alack, I did not respond; blind to the palpable
hint, I simply replied that it was indeed a pity, a great pity; I
often liked to change my pipes, but that this one was so exceptionally
sweet that I had brought no other. He had counted on
my handing it over to him with alacrity, and at once his manner
changed from ‘gay to grave, from lively to severe;’ the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
the journey was passed in an obstinate silence, unbroken save
by the banging of his brazen gongs.</p>

<p>Aban Liah began to show his evil disposition from the very
moment we pulled up at his house; he insisted that Juman should
never enter his house until Usut had been paid. This seemed
designed to thwart the whole Peace-making; not only would
much time be consumed in discussing the payment of Usut which
was not due to Aban Liah, but furthermore the ceremony of
Jawa and total settlement of Usut had been planned to take
place in a day or two at Tama Aping Buling’s. Dr. Hose put a
stop at once to all this nonsense by emphatically telling Aban
Liah that Juman was now travelling with the Government,—that
is, with Dr. Hose himself,—and as the Government intended to
enter any house that was convenient, Juman should follow. I am
thus particular in giving these details because of their tragic consequence
to Aban Liah. In response, Aban Liah gave a grunt,
and, muttering, shut himself up at once in his private room, where
he sulked for half an hour, while the Kayans and Kenyahs were
making themselves quite at home in his veranda. When they
were all seated in groups, Dr. Hose went to the room and dragged
forth the pouting, grumbling, obstinate old creature, and although
the two men, Aban Liah and Juman, were perfectly well acquainted
with each other, Dr. Hose made an elaborate ceremony of introducing
them, as though they had never met before; this formal
introduction really seemed to obliterate all previous hard feeling,
and Aban Liah unbent as though graciously meeting a new
acquaintance. Shortly afterward, our host cleared a space in his
room for us, spread fresh mats, and put his fireplace at the
disposal of our Chinese cook. When we all sat chatting in
the veranda, Aban Liah seized the occasion to expatiate on the
magnificent proportions of the pig that he was going to kill for
us on the morrow, affirming that it was seven spans long (this
was one span better than Tama Liri had held out to us), and
very, <i>very</i> fat! His arrack also was of an especially fine brand,
and plenty of it, too, in jars dusty with age.</p>

<p>Suddenly, messengers hurried in to announce that the Lerons
from the house of the Leppu Anans close by, and friends and
relatives of Tinggi, were on their way down-river to go through
the ceremony of Jawa with Juman and his clan.</p>

GUILTY CONSCIENCE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>The greatest excitement at once ensued; all jumped to their
feet and began talking and gesticulating wildly. Dr. Hose, fearing
that a real fight, instead of a sham one, might be the result,
hurried up-river in a light canoe, to meet the approaching participators
in the Jawa, and to restrain their zeal. These people,
be it remembered, had vowed to kill Dr. Hose on sight, and had
even made death-dealing images both of him and of Tama Bulan,
as I have already mentioned. Dr. Hose’s absolute disregard of
their bloodthirsty threats and machinations disarmed them completely;
he boarded their canoe in the most friendly manner and
accompanied them down-stream.</p>

<p>When they were opposite to Aban Liah’s house, the bravest
in their party fired three or four blank shots from an old muzzle-loading
gun. This salute Juman was bound to answer from the
house. His gun was a breech-loader, but unfortunately so old,
battered, and loose in its joints that a man at the stock stood in
as much danger as a man at the muzzle. Juman’s apology for
his reluctance to fire it off was—(literally translated) ‘Tuan, will
you shoot off this snappang for me; I am afraid its engine has
the fever.’ My assistant, Lewis Etzel, discharged it twice for
him, and then made the hair of the Lerons stand on-end by
discharging from his Winchester rifle six shots, in rapid succession.
After this exchange of salutes, the Lerons disembarked
and entered the house at the up-river end. After all were
assembled in a dense crowd, panting with excitement, their eyes
dilated and flashing, they paused for a second and then gave a
wild yell, like a jeer of derision, and began stamping their feet on
the rattling boards. It was truly deafening. Instantly Juman and
his people were on their feet. There was a quick, frenzied dash,
with yells and stamps, until they stood face to face. This was the
instant that the sham, weaponless fight should have taken place,
leaving black eyes and torn ears. For a moment, it seemed
as though over-excitement would lead to a deeper tragedy.
The reaction came unexpectedly from Juman, the chief actor in this
dramatic show (which in sooth it really was). Juman, brave
enough before a single man, Tinggi, was here overcome by an
attack of—what shall I call it?—stage fright? The next moment
we saw him wilt and ignominiously retreat from the affray. The
wild hubbub subsided weakly. Criticisms of Juman’s conduct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
were at once loudly, freely, and universally expressed. But,
unabashed, he stoutly maintained that he had fulfilled all that
was required of him, and that now was the time for Usut. The
Lerons had killed many of his ancestors in days of yore, and he
demanded of them, as a salve for his wounded feelings, five
‘Tawaks’—(large bronze gongs made in Java) and five small
gongs, (worth in all about three hundred Mexican dollars.) This
considerable sum, the Lerons protested, was far too high a price
to pay for wounds inflicted on Juman’s ancestors and his own
feelings; finally, after much haggling and many excited gesticulations
on both sides, a compromise was struck on one Tawak, one
small gong, and a ‘Lukut sekála,’ one of those invaluable beads,
prized above all others by Kayans, Kenyahs, and Ibans.</p>

<p>(I tried my best to solve the mysterious value of these
beads, but in vain. They are by no means brilliant or showy;
indeed, quite the contrary, they are rather dull and ugly; of
about half an inch in diameter, and on the four quarters there
is a little many-pointed star of dull yellow on a dark background.
They look a good deal like old Venetian glass, but
whence they originally came, or wherein consists their charm,
the natives themselves could not or would not tell. Once on a
time, some astute Chinese traders, counting on an assured
fortune, sent a Lukut sekála to Germany, where it was copied
with really marvellous fidelity. With these faultless imitations
they were certain that they could deceive the natives, but the
latter detected the counterfeit beads at once, and, although willing
to purchase the forgeries, would pay but a pittance for them.)</p>

<p>By the terms of the Usut, whenever the Lerons should pay a
return visit to Juman, he pledged himself to restore the Lukut
sekála.</p>

<p>As soon as Juman’s Usut was finally settled with the Lerons,
Aban Liah’s vaunted seven-span pig was brought forward for
inspection and admiration. Tama Liri at once fell to measuring
it off; when his last span reached the animal’s snout, he arose,
and, gazing round on the circle and wagging his head with a
beaming and triumphant smile, announced that after all the pig
was barely <i>five</i> spans long. The chorus of clucks of surprise
with which this announcement was greeted did not, however, in
the least disconcert the boastful and deceitful old host.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>Jamma, still resplendent in his dirty blue and white jockey
cap and prodigious goggles, hustled about in a most officious
manner, directing the guests and members of the household
where to sit, and what to do, always in a half-apologetic tone, as
if the host, Aban Liah, should be pardoned for not exactly knowing
what was proper. Tama Talip, the Chief of the Lerons, now
that everything in the way of Usut had been paid and snugly
stowed, took his seat among the Kayans and Kenyahs, and
denounced Juman’s demands and rehearsed the deaths among his
forebears due to Juman’s bloodthirsty family. Juman listened
stolidly, evidently not a little pleased to hear how very brave
his ancestors had been. The talk went round the circle, and Jok
Orong began again to drone forth the endless tale of his woes.
The dreary knowledge of what this implied proved too much for
the patience of the white contingent of the Peace-party, and we
all crept unobserved out of the circle, and, having found, on the
banks of the river, an upturned canoe, reclined thereon, and
lazily watched in the gloaming the gigantic fruit-bats, (‘flying
foxes’ they are called,) which were now thickly visible in all
quarters of the sky and all bending their flight in one direction,
toward their nocturnal feeding-ground. They imparted an antediluvian
appearance to the sombre scene, and we seemed to have
travelled back into a remote geologic period, among the pterodactyls.
Not even the golden rays of level sunlight gleaming
forth from beneath lowering clouds on the horizon could dispel
this solemnity. At our feet sluggishly glided the darkening
river, emerging, and again lost, from under the dense jungle on
its banks, whence here and there tall, slender, tufted palms rose
into the silent air from the unbroken green massed about their
feet. On the opposite bank, in the distance, abruptly towered
Mount Dulit, whose purple peaks were glowing with the last rays
of sunlight. And ‘all the air a solemn stillness’ held, save when
at intervals the muffled murmur of Jok Orong’s woes reached us
from the house behind, but did not mar the scene; it partook
of the nature of eternity and infinity; we felt that <i>labitur et
labetur in omne volubilis aevum</i>.</p>

<p>On the next day a great feast was held; as one of the most
important, nay, most vital, of preliminaries, the slaughter of the
pigs took place, and the inspection of their livers for favorable or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
unfavorable omens. The pigs were brought up with their four
feet tied together, and laid in a row outside the circle of Chiefs
and elders in the veranda. Tama Talip, the Chief of the Lerons
as well as an adopted father of Tinggi, whom Juman had slain,
begged Dr. Hose to talk to a pig before it was killed, and enjoin
it to divulge by its liver whether or not the Government was right
in ordering the death of Tinggi. Dr. Hose consented to harangue
the swine, but with much shrewdness, warned the assemblage, in
advance, that no matter what the victim’s liver might indicate, he
had pursued the course that seemed right to him, and would do
so again in spite of all the livers of a thousand pigs. He stood
forth in the centre of the circle, where the pig was lying, and
paused solemnly for all conversation to cease; in spite, however,
of the gravity of his bearing, and the sacredness of the occasion,
some of the light-headed rabble, outside the circle, kept up a
gabbling, whereupon he shouted at them in a voice so loud and
stern, that their teeth chattered, and old Jamma’s hair stood up
stiffer than before. In the pin-drop silence that followed, he
suddenly gave the unsuspecting swine a vigorous kick to enforce
attention, whereto, by an aggrieved squeal, the animal responded
that it was all ears. His harangue was then addressed, partly to
the pig and partly to the Lerons, almost in the following words:—‘Lerons,
it is not one of our customs to ask from a pig what is in
the hearts of men, but you people of up-river have faith in this
custom and believe that a pig knows your feelings, [cries of
‘Betúl! Betúl!’—True! True!] I will on this occasion adopt
your custom and talk to this pig. You tell me that this pig
understands Malay, so I will talk in that language, that all may
understand, Kayans, Kenyahs, Sibops, Berawans, and Lerons.
Know then, that it was neither Juman nor Tama Bulan who slew
Tinggi and his brother Sidup, but I, the Government, did it, and
none other. If you have any fault to find, find it with me.
Remember that, you, Tama Talip, there! And now, O sacred
pig, tell us who is in the wrong and who is in the right. [Here,
the pig receives another and vigorous call upon its attention, and
responds befittingly.] If men of the Tinjar kill people, I will
order men from the Baram to find the murderers and slay them.
If men of the Baram kill people, I will order Tinjar men to find
the murderers and slay them. Let this declaration of mine sink<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
into your livers, all you people from both rivers, and never forget
it.’ With these concluding words, he stamped his foot so
suddenly and so loudly, that the old men, already awed by the
silence and the solemnity of the hour, jumped almost from the floor,
and Jamma shook his goggles off. Immediately the cry arose,—‘Kill
the pig instantly, that he may hear nothing else to influence
him!’ The poor beast was then quickly seized and taken
to one side, and its neck sawed through with a dull parang, and
before its death-struggles were fully over, its warm liver was
deposited in a wooden bowl, and passed round the assembly for
close inspection. They all tried to look extremely wise and
expressed their opinions in a grave undertone to their neighbors;
an old man, with one eye and a faded green velvet smoking-cap,
winked and blinked at it, and then pensively resumed the mastication
of a betel nut. Jamma pawed and fingered the liver all
over, but maintained an ominous silence. Tama Talip screwed
his mouth up on one side with a foreboding expression, clasped
his hands over his knees, and began rocking backward and forward.
The atmosphere became charged with perplexity and deep
anxiety. Evidently, the fateful liver was only possibly favorable,
and certainly dubious. The gall-bladder extended down nearly
to the edge of the liver, and the small lobe which lies beside it
was thin and long; so far, these features meant long life and
prosperity. The chief points, which involved perplexity not
unmixed with deep dismay, were that the lobe which represented
the Government, was small, hard, and firm, while its inner border
was ominously like a cord set into the surrounding substance;
and, worst of all, above the attachment of the gall-bladder was
an unprecedented, deeply indented scar, as if some of the liver had
actually melted away! Consternation began to deepen. It was
a hazardous minute for the Government. But Dr. Hose rose to
the occasion, and at once proclaimed to all the clear and manifest
interpretation of the extraordinary message from the pig. He
asserted that the liver most unmistakably revealed to them, by
the hardness of its lobe, the strength and unswerving justice of
the Government, and that it was most difficult to break, while at
the same time, it was as clear as noon-day that the thick, cord-like
border showed how firmly the Government was united to
the best interests of the people. Then turning to the scar above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the gall-bladder, he made their very souls quiver and their flesh
creep, by declaring that it unquestionably foretold the speedy
and inevitable death of some very important Chief! (A little
wholesome terror is a happy solvent in governing these people.)
Several of the Chiefs present would have turned pale, if they
could, at this frightful, terrifying revelation, but possibly they
consoled themselves with the thought, hitherto unacknowledged
by their self-conceit, that perhaps they were not so very, very
important after all.</p>

<p>No one dared raise a dissenting voice to Dr. Hose’s lucid and
manifest interpretation. A good instance, by the way, of one of
the sources of his influence over them; he always contrives to
turn to the Government’s account their superstitions and fears.</p>

<p>Aban Liah, our host, was the most apprehensive of all present.
He well knew that he had once been all-important in his tribe,
and that he had been unfaithful and treacherous to the Government;
wherefore, the better to conceal his deadly fear, and revive
his courage, he had his large jars of arrack brought out, and
ostentatiously cut the dusty stiff rattans which bound down the
covers. The first drink was tendered to the interminable Jok
Orong, the guest from the Rejang, to whom all desired to show
friendship and promise protection to his people should they move
into the Baram district. He gulped down the drink quickly,
but not so quickly that the crowd had not time enough to stamp
and shout in the customary manner so mightily that the house
most alarmingly trembled, creaked, and swayed, until caution
prompted us to secure safe positions over good, strong beams; no
accident happened, however, although a tremendous uproar
accompanied the quaffing by each Chief. Before the second
round of drinks, Dr. Hose insisted that they should deliver their
speeches and protestations of peace while their brains were still
unclouded, and as a preliminary the officious Jamma killed a
fowl over a bowl of water, and then with a brush of wood cut
into a tuft of shavings at one end spattered the blood and water
over the audience. Then, still holding the blood-smeared brush
in his hand, he launched into a vehement harangue, proclaiming
this to be the very greatest of all Peace-makings that had ever
been known on the banks of the Tinjar, and that the pig’s liver
had shown them clearly and truly the strength and benefit of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Government. When he had nearly shaken off his absurd goggles
and his jockey cap had assumed a jaunty air on the back of his
head, he handed the bloodied brush over to Juman, who at
once jumped to his feet, and in the Kayan language began to tell
in a truly sensible way how he and Tama Bulan had been commanded
by the Government to bring Tinggi to justice. He then
deliberately narrated all the details of the killing, (which must
have been pleasant to the ears of Tama Talip, the adopted father
of Tinggi,) but gradually he worked himself up to a high pitch of
excitement, beating the air with his arms, see-sawing backward
and forward, and emphasising the close of each sentence by
shouting ‘Bahh! Bahh!’ He asserted that he was but the servant
of the Government when he killed Tinggi, and so staunch was
his loyalty that, should the Government command him to kill
his dear friend Tama Usong, he would hold it to be his duty to
obey. His excitement soon over-mastered him, and when he
began to indulge in bravado, and offer to engage any one member
of Tinggi’s family in single combat, we deemed it high time to
pull him down into his seat, and then plied him with congratulations,
just as though he had fully rounded off his speech and
finished all he wanted to say.</p>

<p>While he was on his feet, drinks had been passing around
quietly and some of the older men, whose heads were none too
strong, began to feel alcoholic effects. Old Aban Anyi, a devoted
follower of Tama Usong, and a hero of many battles, who once
told me with pride that he had killed many men, any quantity of
women, and no end of children, hearing Juman boast that he
would kill Tama Usong if he were so ordered by the Government,
tried to get on his feet to challenge such braggart talk, but Tama
Usong himself grabbed him forcibly by the back of his waist-cloth
and thumped him down to his seat again, where he sat
mumbling and protesting until soothed and silenced with another
drink. The bloody ‘<i>pla</i>,’ or wooden brush, was next passed to
Aban Liah, but his speech was weak and very apologetic throughout;
he asserted that the Government had treated him badly by
degrading him just because he did not tell the whereabouts of
the murderers, Tinggi and Sidup; indeed, he never knew who the
murderers were. Now the fact was that we knew, and all his
hearers knew, that he had lied egregiously and persistently about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
the murderers, and had even concealed them in his own house.
All this had been fully proved after the murderers had been
killed. It was the sufficing cause of his loss of the Penghulu-ship.</p>

<p>Tama Usong’s turn came next to declare his good will to the
people of the Tinjar, and before he began, a large cup of arrack
was thrust upon him. The contents of the jars had become, by
this time, nearly exhausted; consequently this cupfull had been
dipped up from the dregs, and Tama Usong gulped into his
mouth several large pasty lumps of fermented rice. In the
embarrassment caused by holding the pla (which seems to be
essential to public speaking) he blew the kernels of rice accidentally,
but directly in his host’s face. The arrack was painfully
present in his rambling and incoherent speech, to which no one
paid any attention. At its conclusion all the Chiefs drank in
turn from the same cup, and the formal part of the programme
of the meeting ended.</p>

<p>Having gathered about him a fresh and untried audience, Jok
Orong started in again with his endless, life-long tale of woe,
which, we knew, only too well, would last until the arrack was
utterly exhausted as well as his hearers; we, therefore, left them
incontinently, preferring the peace and quiet of the Leppu Anan
house, a short distance up-river, to the fingered feast of stewed
fat pork with which Aban Liah was about to regale his guests.</p>

<p>The Leppu Anans are a clan from the Rejang, which not long
before had been driven over to the Baram district by a threatened
onslaught of the Ibans, who by some underhand means had
obtained permission from the Government to attack them with
a regularly organized force. Dr. Hose, hearing that this expedition
had started, and knowing that the permission had been granted
to the Ibans on false pretexts, and inasmuch as in this matter of
life and death there was no time to communicate with the
Government, instantly sent swift messengers to the homes of
the Leppu Anans, telling them to fly for their lives, and promising
them protection if they settled on the Tinjar. It was a terrible
journey for the poor innocent creatures, loaded down, as
they were, with all their household effects and retarded in their
haste by the care for the women and children. Many of them,
I was told, were so exhausted that they actually crawled and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
dragged themselves on all fours down the hills which separate
the Rejang and Tinjar valleys.</p>

<p>The Ibans, consequently, found the Leppu Anan houses
deserted and stripped of everything movable. Whereupon, not
to be baulked of all spoils whatever, they attacked some of the
friendly houses, the abodes of the very people who, on their
journey up-river, had cheerily and kindly wished them success
in their head-hunting. To the Bornean a head is a head, whether
of friend or foe; so on this occasion the Ibans returned to their
homes laden with spoils of their friends and enriched with heads
which had not been on the shoulders of those against whom they
had set out.</p>

<p>The Leppu Anans, in their new house, although they still
harboured the small clan of Lerons who had vowed vengeance
on Dr. Hose, nevertheless regarded Dr. Hose as their preserver,
and no trouble taken in his behalf could be too great. They are
quiet and gentle in their manners and very clean in their persons
and about the house. We noticed with much relief that they
did not throng about us, asking such inane questions the minute
that we had landed, as, ‘When did you arrive?’ or, when helping
us to disembark, ‘Did you come in a boat?’—questions
which are really not at all unusual even from the very men who
have been paddling your boat all day long. Possibly, true
etiquette demands such questions among the natives themselves,
who, for some occult reason, always desire their actual arrival
and departure to pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>These Leppu Anans were intensely interested in my photographs,
and literally climbed on each other’s shoulders to see
them. In their anxiety to touch the page itself, they nearly
crushed the lucky holder of the book. The picture which
excited their unstinted admiration is of two Ibans bargaining for
the sale of a highly prized Chinese jar; they read the meaning of
it at once, explaining it over and over to each other; but opinion
was divided as to the balance of trade; some thought the owner
was a fool to refuse the pile of silver dollars which the purchaser
was offering, while others contended that the man who offered so
mean a sum for so fine a jar must have been crazy. (When I
showed the photograph to the wife of the man who had posed
for me as the owner, she was extremely indignant, protesting that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
I had no right to represent Angas as such a fool! No sensible
man would ever refuse that pile of money for such a common
old jar. She felt actually defrauded of all that wealth, and I
am sure she looked on me as a thief.)</p>

<p>At noon the next day the Peace-party, which we had left to
finish up the ‘seven’ span pig at Aban Liah’s, came up-river, and
we all set out together on the last stage of the journey to Tama
Aping Buling’s.</p>

<p>It was an exciting day’s travel; the rapids were extremely
swift, and the Kayans, Kenyahs, Sibops, Berawans, Leppu Anans,
and Lerons became inextricably intermingled in forcing their
canoes past dangerous rocks and through narrows where the
water rushed with almost irresistible power. Every man of the
large assemblage was at the highest tension of excitement in
anticipation of the stirring ceremonies close at hand, which after
all, in the twinkling of an eye, by the merest accident, or by some
trivial flaw in etiquette amid so large a body of hostile clans,
might be converted to bloody battle.</p>

<p>When Tama Bulan was forced to leave us and turn back with
his sick nephew, he provided, with usual forethought, a small
pig, which was to be swiftly forwarded to Tama Aping Buling’s
in advance of the Peace-party. In punctillious observance of
native customs on such exalted occasions as the present, the pig
must be sacrificed on the beach before the Kayans and Kenyahs
disembarked. We were positively assured by Aban Liah on
leaving his house, that the piglet had been sent on ahead the
night before to Tama Aping Buling’s house at Long Dapoi;
wherefore, when the Peace-party arrived, everything would be
ceremoniously carried out. Our boat, a little in advance of the
others, was gliding smoothly on a long stretch of quiet water
just above turbulent rapids, when we were met by some men in
a canoe from Tama Aping Buling’s; a short excited announcement
from them revealed to us that all was not going rightly
up-river; accordingly, we changed to their lighter boat, and sped
up-stream, leaving our luggage and the Peace-party to follow
as they could. The men who poled the canoe could talk but
very little of any language but Sibop, so we hardly knew what
was amiss until we arrived at the house. On the beach, we were
met by Tama Aping Buling himself, almost in tears; before we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
could get fairly out of the boat, he squatted down, and, in a voice
of despair, said, ‘Oh, Tuan Prenta, what shall be done! No pig
has been sent to sacrifice when the Kayans arrive. There will be
war instead of peace.’ It was even so. That old traitor, Aban
Liah, had purposely kept back Tama Bulan’s pig in order that
the Peace-making should be a failure, and that his rival, Tama
Aping Buling, should get into trouble. Dr. Hose instantly
turned and started down-stream to meet the Kayans, and keep
them down-river until Aban Liah should either restore the pig
or procure another and send it on ahead of them. Aban Liah
was serenely imperturbable when accused to his face of the theft
of the pig, and of his plot to create trouble; but eventually Dr.
Hose’s unsparing denunciation, combined with the sullen threats
of the tired Kayans, eager for the comfortable shelter of a house
for the night, forced him actually to leave the party, and paddle
off down-river to buy or borrow the indispensable little pig.</p>

</figure>

<p>They told us afterward that at house after house he was
rebuffed, and, although there were plenty of pigs everywhere,
not one could he borrow, beg, or steal, so universally disliked
was he for his mean, tricky ways. Night came before he finally
succeeded in procuring the sacrifice, so that the wearied Kayans
were forced to sleep in their canoes, or in huts of boughs which
they built on a pebbly island in midstream, and endure a drenching
deluge of rain, illumined by such blinding lightning and
deafening thunder as only the Tropics know.</p>

<p>The house built by Tama Aping Buling stands on the north
bank of the river, just opposite to the mouth of the Dapoi, a
large tributary. It is about two hundred feet from the river, on a
high bank which slopes gradually to a wide pebbly beach. The
house was only recently finished at that time, and had cost interminable
labor; many of the piles whereon it was built were at
least twenty inches in diameter, and supported the floor fully
fifteen feet from the ground. The veranda was broad and well
floored with wide, hewn planks, and roofed with shingles of
billian wood, not nailed to the rafters, but tied on with strips of
rattan. One end of the house was not yet quite finished, and
shingles only partially covered it. This incomplete state was not,
however, without its uses; it supplied Tama Aping Buling, while
showing his house to us, with a chance to make a remark, which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
hackneyed and threadbare as it is among them, is always uttered
apparently in the belief that it will be received with all the
applause of a novel and brilliant idea. With a wave of his hand
toward the roofless rafters, Tama Aping explained, ‘This end of
the house is occupied by Laki Langit and his children,’ which,
interpreted, means, ‘Grandfather Sky and his children—the stars!’
We had heard the witticism so often that it was hard to force a
smile,—but we did. Let him among us, who, in describing ‘full
dress,’ has never called it ‘war-paint’ or ‘best bib and tucker,’
cast the first reproach at the unsophisticated Borneans.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning the wee pig was sacrificed
on the beach and there left in its gore. Such a sacrifice, when
made in ratification of a compact, renders the flesh inedible to
all participants in the ceremony; hence the diminutive size of the
pig. On the present occasion Aban Liah’s enforced pig was so
extremely small, that I saw a lean and hungry dog seize it by
the head after the sacrifice was over, and, slinging the body over
his back, make off toward some tall grass, where he probably
devoured the whole carcass at one meal,—possibly, at one
gulp.</p>

<p>The sacrifice of the pig was certainly a beginning, but it did
not seem to expedite the other ceremonies to be performed in
the veranda of the house. The Kayans, never enthusiastic over
this Peace-making, (which is not a fraternisation, but only an
agreement not to kill each other on unprovoked raids,) were
sulking in their huts on the karangans, under the pretext of
drying themselves. All the while Tama Aping Buling and his
clan, and the other Tinjar Chiefs and their clans, sat wearily waiting
in the veranda for the Kayans to appear. There were several
false reports that they were coming, and each time the host,
Tama Aping, invariably alleged that most important matters
needed attention in his private room, and as invariably had to be
dragged, trembling, from his little dark sleeping-box, where he was
crouching, to attend to the reception of his guests. One cause
of Tama Aping’s conduct was dread lest it should leak out that
he had been largely instrumental in giving the Government the
information which eventually led to the detection of Tinggi and
his brother, Sidup, both of whom had been, in point of fact, at
one time inmates of his house; should this treachery become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
known, his own people, even, would turn against him, and his
life would not be worth a black bead.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>TAMA APING BULING’S HOUSE ON THE TINJAR.</p>

<p>THE SCENE OF THE NOTABLE PEACE-MAKING.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The forenoon passed; the day wore on to afternoon,—still no
Kayans; we began to fear that they had turned back and had
given up all idea of peace-making.</p>

<p>Jamma of the flabby, unhealthy lips, talked interminably, and
his goggles seemed to grow bigger and his jockey cap dirtier every
minute. Tama Talip silently munched betel nut, and squirted
the blood-red juice incessantly through a crack in the floor.
Aban Liah was depressed in spirit, and sat sullenly twisting an
extinguished cigarette between his fingers. We became thoroughly
wearied of the whole assemblage, and, unattended, paddled
across the river to a grassy point where we could watch for the
coming of the Kayans, and, at least for awhile, get rid of the
natives. Even this watching became intolerable, and finally we
decided to go up the clear Dapoi River a short distance and take
a swim. Of course, this was the very time through the perversity
of luck, that the Kayans decided to go up to the house,
and we, unfortunately, were not on hand. Kilup, one of Tinggi’s
brothers, took it upon himself to be the leader of a small Jawa
party, and did not even wait for Juman to disembark from his
canoe, but ran full speed down to the beach, and with his parang
drawn,—a violation of propriety absolutely forbidden in every
well-conducted Jawa—actually chopped at Juman’s boat and
slashed the palm-leaf covering. They told us afterward that
Juman behaved bravely, and sat unmoved in his boat,—his
serenity was possibly due to the knowledge that the ‘snappang,’
albeit with the ‘fever-stricken engine,’ was at his side, and that,
if necessity arose, its discharge would prove fatal to some one,
either to himself or to Kilup. By the time we returned from our
bath the excitement had subsided, but none the less, Tama
Aping Buling remained secluded in the depths of his private
apartments. Dr. Hose at once summoned Kilup before him,
and incontinently imposed on him a fine of one tawak,—equivalent
to thirty dollars, a really heavy fine. Kilup sat unmoved
during his sentence, and then arose slowly and swaggered off
to his room, where he was told to remain until sent for, under
penalty of another fine, or, possibly, imprisonment in the Baram
Fort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>The Kayans were very naturally greatly incensed at such
treatment; certainly they had a right to expect a little more
hospitality after their dolorous night in the soaking rain.</p>

<p>By way of precaution against too much zeal in the approaching
sham fight, we made the Tinjar people place about half-way
down the veranda a high, square platform, used ordinarily as a
sleeping-shelf for guests; this would tend to keep the two forces
apart and check too quick an onslaught. When this was done,
Tama Liri was deputed to go down to the river and conduct the
Kayans to the veranda. It is an inexcusable breach of decorum
for any strangers outside the house, to pass in front of a Chief’s
door, before ascending to the veranda; guests, therefore, from
down-river should enter at the down-river end of the house, and
<i>vice versâ</i>. Tama Liri knew this as well as he knew his name;
but, solely to stir up more trouble, he conducted the Kayans who
came from down-river to the up-river end of the house, which
involved a direct insult to Tama Aping Buling. Of course, the
Kayans remonstrated, but too late; and then, to retrieve the
insult, had to tramp almost the whole length of the house in the
mud and slime beneath the veranda; this added fresh fuel to the
fire already burning in their breasts.</p>

<p>The Lerons, Sibops, Berawans, and Leppu Anans gathered
at the up-river end of the veranda, to await the entrance of the
Kayans, and we placed ourselves midway, so as to be on hand
to moderate, if possible, too realistic a sham fight.</p>

<p>The Kayans and Kenyahs came quietly up the notched log,
and halted in a close crowd until the last man had fairly entered
the veranda. Standing thus within the house of one who had
always been an enemy, and confronting their deadly foes, it is no
wonder that they were trembling with excitement; their eyes
were glancing suspiciously in all directions to detect any signs
of treachery or the sight of concealed weapons. Suddenly, with
one impulse, they began yelling, stamping, waving their arms,
and leaping in the air. Immediately the Tinjar people joined in;
in a second the whole veranda from end to end became a perfect
pandemonium of shrieking, frenzied, gymnastic savages. Not a
step did they advance toward each other, although everywhere
there were furious, threatening gestures.</p>

<p>This appalling scene was kept up for fully a minute, and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the frightful turbulence gradually quieted down. Dr. Hose at
once seized Juman by the arm and led him, followed by his
people, right in among their bitter enemies; then glancing round
quickly to see that no one had a weapon in hand, instantly proposed
that they should all once more jump and stamp together,
and he himself led off with a resounding stamp and a terrific
shout. Juman followed, then another and another, until, in a
trice, once more the house was trembling beneath them, and the
rafters echoing; but this time friends and foes were almost
shoulder to shoulder. The inanity, I think, of the proceeding
slowly dawned on them; the shouting did not last as long as
before; it became more and more feeble; at last it ceased suddenly,
and they all sat down. Little by little the ice of mutual
distrust began to thaw; here and there men who had been
mortal foes were sitting cheek by jowl, engaged in friendly conversation.</p>

<p>At this stage, it was the host’s clear duty to bring out his
arrack; his guests might at once have pledged each other, and
friendship might have been cemented; but Tama Aping Buling
was in his sleeping-room, probably buried beneath a pile of mats.</p>

<p>Speeches were made by Jamma, Aban Liah, and Juman,
but they lacked earnestness and cordiality, and, at their conclusion,
the pigs whose livers were to foretell the issue of this
Peace-making and the futurity of the participants, were dragged
into the centre of the assembly. As each one was brought in,
it was harangued by the Dayongs, and adjured to tell the truth
and to intercede with the Spirits to drive out all animosity from
the people of the two rivers. The largest pig was reserved as
the ‘Government’s pig,’ and had been selected on account of its
size and beauty, but it did not turn out to be exactly what the
Government would have chosen as its fittest representative. It
was an albino, with lack-lustre, whitish eyes and a pale, mottled
snout; it lay so still that I half expected it was about to cheat
the sacrifice by dying a natural death. Of course, it fell to Dr.
Hose’s lot to exhort this pig <i>ante mortem</i> to proclaim truthfully
<i>post mortem</i>, by infallible omens in its liver, whether or not the
Government’s course was right; but he gave the natives clearly
to understand that, whatever the omens might be, they would
not in the least influence him in the management of Government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
affairs; and that he followed the custom merely to please them.
Thereupon, he prodded the pale-eyed and anæmic pig with his
foot, to arouse its earnest attention, but no responsive grunt nor
indignant squeal came from that cadaverous representative of the
Government; it lay imperturbably still and blinked. As soon as
his words ceased, the pig was dragged to one side, its throat cut,
and its liver at once dexterously extracted. When this organ,
which proved to be unusually large, was passed round among
the Chiefs and among those who were skilled in the interpretation
of auguries, it was pronounced with one accord to be in its every
aspect most favourable; but, in an unlucky moment, just as it
was about to be taken away, some one, inquisitively, lifted one of
the lobes to examine the under surface, and instantly a convulsive
horror and shuddering recoil ran through the whole assemblage,—a
large, foul abscess was disclosed!</p>

<p>Once before, on this expedition, had the natives been shocked
by a fateful foreboding of death, and now, for a second time,
in yet clearer terms, had this death-warrant been delivered. On
the first occasion, at Tama Liri’s house, their horrified eyes had
noted a deep scar, and now with inexpressible dismay they beheld
a corroding ulcer.</p>

<p>Dr. Hose, in solemn tones, again repeated the true interpretation
of the blood-curdling portent:—<i>a faithless, scheming Chief</i>,
who was secretly hostile to the Rajah and to his people, would
<i>very shortly die a miserable, inevitable death</i>! Again the liver
was passed round the awe-stricken circle; in vain they summoned
their best ingenuity in suggesting a less dreadful interpretation,
but it was only too clear that Dr. Hose’s words bore every
impress of truth.</p>

<p>Old Aban Liah, of whose hostility to the Government there
had been such recent proofs, sat a little outside the circle, and
when the liver with its death-warrant was passed over to him, he
waved it aside, and in tones that reminded me vividly of Shylock,
and almost in Shylock’s very words, said, tremulously, ‘Let me
go away; I am not well;’ and then added, apologetically: ‘the
smell of this beastly, warm, raw flesh has made me ill. I must
go.’ And he got up, with dazed looks, and went with uncertain
steps to his room.</p>

<p>An hour or two later, in the evening, some of his friends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
came and begged me to go see him. To my surprise, I found
him in a high fever and semi-delirious. I directed them to wrap
him up warmly, to produce a sweat, and advised them to remove
him to his own home as soon as possible. I supposed that he
would be all right in the morning, when the effects of the feasting
at his house the day before had passed off. I never dreamed
that his illness would have a fatal termination.</p>

<p>Neither Aban Liah’s sudden illness, nor his absence, interfered
with the Peace-making. Kilup was summoned from his room,
and in the presence of the assembled tribes he was given such a
vehement rating by the Government that he probably remembers
it to this hour, and he was furthermore warned that even threatening
language was punishable.</p>

<p>Still no arrack was broached, nor feast spread. At the
slightest noise or excitement, off sped Tama Aping Buling to his
room, and there remained in seclusion until all was again quiet.
He had, in truth, more cause for alarm than the others; his wife,
his children, and all the women of the household were dependent
on him for protection in any outbreak of hostility; his guests
had to look but after their own safety; these guests were now
peaceable, but in a flash they might become mortal foes in
deadly conflict.</p>

<p>Old Jamma was always to the fore, talking incessantly and
making effusive attempts to ingratiate himself with everybody;
but if all present shared my feelings, his thick, everted lips, and
eyes distorted behind those prodigious goggles, would have
checked every throb of sympathy. Furthermore, he had unaccountably
changed his jockey cap for a war-cap of Tiger skin,
with which he fairly terrified the Kayans. A skin of the great
tiger is something so terrible to many of the natives that they
dare not even touch it; an oath bound by a tiger’s tooth or
tiger’s skin is one of their most solemn pledges. The Kenyahs
and Sibops are the only tribes who may touch a Tiger’s skin
with impunity.</p>

<p>It was not until afternoon had deepened into night that the
feast and the arrack were brought out. The roar that went up
when Juman drained the first cup could have been heard certainly
for a mile, and the stamping was stupendous. In fact, under the
weight of the three hundred jumping men, the floor sagged fully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
six inches, and the huge piles, whereon the house was built,
swerved and sank deeper into the earth. Thus it went on, one
toast after another, and roar upon roar; then they made speeches
fervid with alcohol. Jamma talked rank, open treason when his
tongue was loosened, and claimed the whole Tinjar River as a
direct inheritance from his Uncle, Aban Jau; the Rajah had no
right to be there, and the Government obstructed instead of
helped the people. Very little attention, however, was paid to
him, either by the assemblage, or by Dr. Hose, a neglect which
cut him deeply; he ached to be of sufficient importance to
receive a rebuke from the Government, but Dr. Hose merely
replied, ‘We must all bear in mind the source whence these
silly remarks come; I think you’ll all agree that they are not
of the slightest consequence.’</p>

<p>The drinking, the stamping, and the shouting were kept up
throughout the night, and, to our great content, the Kayan
guests behaved well and restrained themselves within bounds.
Jamma and his clan were the only flagrant offenders, talking
treason and indulging in threats.</p>

<p>A smell of fermented arrack, stale fumes of rank tobacco,
maudlin gabble from drunken men, the snarling and yelping of
dogs, the clucking and cackling of poultry, the wailing of children,
and the crying of babies, pervaded the world into which
we awoke in Tama Aping Buling’s house the morning after the
great Peace-making carouse.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above all sounds, arose repeated, piercing shrieks
from terror-stricken women, excited shouting of men, slamming
of doors, and the clatter of bare feet fleeing over the loose, rattling
boards of the veranda. The master of the house flung
himself, trembling, into our room and breathlessly announced
that one of his men, overcome by the night’s debauch, had gone
‘amok’—as he said,—and, armed with parang and shield, had
sworn to hack in pieces all whom he met; he was now rushing
from room to room slashing right and left at the terrified and
fugitive inmates. Two or three brave men had climbed to the
loft above the partitions between the private rooms, and, with
poles, were trying to beat down and disarm the maniac and
lasso him with loops of rattan.</p>

<p>A man who runs amok both expects and desires to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
killed, but endeavors to slaughter beforehand as many victims
as possible. Dr. Hose caught up a long and heavy pestle used
for husking rice, and we all hurried out in the veranda, armed
with our revolvers, to assist in the capture of this most dangerous
ruffian; and, since he desired to be killed, we were quite ready to
gratify him. Just as we came opposite the room from which the
maniac had driven the occupants, frantic with terror, the man
himself rushed forth directly in front of Dr. Hose, but the latter
was ready for him with a greeting which was as well-directed and
cordial as it was unexpected. By one waive of the long pestle,
his shield was instantly thrust aside, and there followed a disconcerting
and most demoralising prod full in the pit of the stomach.
All his valiant ‘amok’ collapsed, and, with eyes rolling in his
head, he staggered back through the doorway and plumped
down, with a flop, on the floor. Instantly the men overhead,
with their rattan loops, had him encircled round the waist, and a
vigorous pull suspended him in mid-air from a cross-beam;
with their poles they knocked the weapons from his hands, and
then, like a spider with a fly, they had him quickly swathed with
rattans and bound hand and foot. The next thing was to take
him to his own room, and leave him thus confined until he had
recovered his senses. But while they were carrying him thither,
the ever-officious, and withal treacherous, Jamma, staggered
impetuously forward, and, vehemently insisting that the maniac
should be set free, actually began to grapple with the carriers.
In a twinkling, his wrist was seized by Dr. Hose, and he was
whirled round; then, after executing an astonishing and dizzy
pirouette, he lost his balance and went skimming along the floor,
until, with a reverberating thump, his head struck the wall, and
he lay motionless. Some friends ran to him and propped him
up. He made no attempt to rise, but only blinked his bloodshot
eyes, denuded for once of the goggles, and kept gasping, panting
forth: ‘Why did the Government strike me? Why did the
Government strike me?’ Finding his question unanswered, he
lapsed into silence, and put in practice the ingenious idea of
feigning death, wherein he was much helped by a sudden rush
of alcoholic fumes to his head. His nephew and a few devoted
friends lost not an instant’s time in laying out the corpse, and,
seated beside the limp body, immediately struck up a funeral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
wail over his sad, untimely demise. It really seemed possible
that the man might be dead, so, at Dr. Hose’s request, I examined
him, but no trace of injury could I find on the corpse but a
severe, darkly coloured bruise on its forehead; when, however,
this bruise was bathed with arnica, I noticed that it wholly disappeared,
and the discoloration was transferred to the absorbent
cotton, and that the skin presented an unbroken surface. When
I attempted to examine his eyes, the wrinkled resistance of the
lids showed me his inflexible determination to remain dead.</p>

<p>Disgusted with the whole household, we had our luggage
incontinently carried down to the boats; then, after speeding the
Kayans and Kenyahs, now in a benign and peaceful mood, on their
homeward journey, the Great, Historic, Ceremonial Peace-making
came to an end. It had been a veritable and a notable success
throughout; old scores had been settled by exchange of Usut
and by the Jawa, and return visits had been planned; barring
Aban Liah’s antagonism and illness, Kilup’s bad behavior, and
the incident with Jamma just related, everything had gone off
more smoothly than we had any reason to expect, considering the
undisciplined, grown-up children with whom we had to deal. We
were, nevertheless, truly glad to be rid of the responsibility of a
party so large, and of material so inflammable.</p>

<p>We decided to continue our journey, and ascend the Dapoi
River, to visit some Punans,—a nomadic tribe, who had recently
encamped near the head-waters of the stream.</p>

<p>Just as we were pushing off in our canoe, a wild figure, with
arms waving, and face distorted with malignant rage, dashed
down the log-walk to the beach; there it turned and faced the
house. It was Jamma, the corpse. Snatching off his war-cap
of Tiger skin, he waved it, backward and forward above his head
with frantic gestures, toward the house. We did not care to wait
for the upshot of these remarkable antics, but pursued our tranquil
course up the Dapoi, inhaling peace and repose beneath the
over-arching boughs festooned with ferns and orchids.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>SIBOP WOMEN AT THE HOUSE OF TAMA BALAN DENG.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Late in the afternoon, we landed at the house of Tama Balan
Deng, a Sibop Chief, who received us kindly, and most hospitably
gave up to us his own room, wherein throughout every minute
of the entire night we were the objects of awestruck curiosity to
his whole household, the larger part of whom had never before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
seen a white man; they sat immovably huddled together at one
side of the room, and were the last objects that we saw on going
to sleep, and when we awoke at dawn they were noiselessly
creeping away.</p>

<p>Early in the day, to our surprise, Tama Aping Buling arrived
in his canoe, in a state of painful excitement over Jamma’s conduct
of the day before, whose antics were now explained. As
soon as we had left, the old rascal, tired of being a corpse, fell
into a violent rage with the universe, and had stormed down to
the beach, and there had cursed with his awful Tiger skin cap
every bit of timber in the house, together with all its inmates, big
and little, old and young, and all the Kayans, root and branch,
who had been in it, and ended up with the white men who had
half-killed him. The house, as I said above, had just been built,
at a cost of infinite labor and great expense; but after such a
blood-curdling curse had been launched at it, to Tama Aping
Buling’s superstitious mind, the domicile was for ever banned and
ruined. The object of the poor fellow’s hurried visit was to ask
Dr. Hose if he did not think it best that the whole structure
should be immediately destroyed; it took much serious argument
from Dr. Hose to dissuade the disconsolate Tama Aping
from the determination to empty his house of all movables and
then set fire to it.</p>

<p>This account of Jamma’s malevolence did not exhaust Tama
Aping’s budget. He brought the latest news of Aban Liah,
whom we had last seen stricken down by the dreadful omen in
the pig’s liver. The most skilful Dayongs had been summoned to
keep the soul of the old Berawan Chief from wholly deserting
his body, and, at last reports, they had grave doubts as to their
success in finding whither it had temporarily flown, unless several
additional parang blades and three or four more bolts of cloth
were given to them, wherewith they could bribe the Spirits who
were luring far away the soul of Aban Liah; they were sorely
afraid that, in spite of all their exertions, the soul would evade
them and slip off to Bulun Matai. We despatched the necessary
spiritual bribes, and then continued our journey to the home of
the Punans.</p>

<p>Four days afterward, when we left the Dapoi and again turned
into the Tinjar, we stopped at the scene of the Great Peace making,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
and there we learned the end of Aban Liah’s tragic story.
The fate foretold so clearly by the liver of the Government’s
albino pig had been fulfilled. The conscience-stricken soul of the
faithless Aban Liah had, indeed, departed to the Fields of the
Dead. From the moment that he saw that ulcerous liver, and
realized its plain indication to himself he sickened, became delirious,
and within forty-eight hours was dead!</p>

<p>There happened to be in one of the boats of our party an old
woman, a distant relative of Aban Liah, and when the news of
his death was first shouted to us from a boat which we met on the
river, this old creature withdrew a short distance from the bank,
and, squatting down on the sand, proceeded to emit a solo of
heart-rending wails for the dead, rehearsing his good qualities in
a jerky and descending chromatic scale, beginning at high C and
ending when her breath gave out; then, after a deep inspiration,
the wailing strain was resumed. All the while she was glancing
around to see the effect it had upon us, and also to see what was
going on up and down the river while she was busy in sorrowing
for the defunct; she knew, quite as well as we, what a thorough-paced
old rascal he was, and how far better it was for all his
household that he was dead and out of the way. When she had
reeled off a due amount of profound sorrow, she re-embarked,
and was as chatty and gay as possible until we reached the dead
Chief’s house; there it behooved her to roar again for appearance’s
sake. We went up to the house of mourning to pay our
respects to the household and be witness to their grief. At the
hour of our arrival, there happened to be a lull in the wailing,
but the appearance of visitors of such august importance at once
demanded a resumption, not only of gong-beating, but also of
the recitation of the estimable, noble character of the departed.
The obtrusive old Jamma was again to the fore, all animosity
forgotten in his eagerness to display his extreme grief; out of
respect for the dead he had discarded his jockey cap and goggles.
Several other Chiefs from neighbouring houses and ourselves
were led to places of honor in front of the bier, whereon lay
Aban Liah, sealed up in a coffin hewn out of Durian wood. The
bier was draped with some cotton cloth, which we recognized as
that which we had sent as a bribe to the Spirits, and on posts
at the four corners were hung the Chief’s most valuable beads,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
his parang, shield, and spear, and a number of musical instruments;
it was expected that he would hold a high position
among the minstrels and warriors in Bulun Matai. As soon as
the chief men had conducted us to our places, they squatted
beside us, and, covering their faces with their hands to hide the
scalding tears that did not flow, they began to moan and groan
in a style which was, perhaps, quite as symbolical to them of true
sorrow as black crape and nodding plumes are to us.</p>

<p>At this moment, the women of the dead man’s immediate
family issued from his private room, clad in high-pointed yellow
hoods of bark-cloth, which flowing down enveloped them from
head to foot; they gathered about the head of the coffin, and
wailed to the accompaniment of several deep-toned gongs. This
same rite had been repeated for every visitor who had come to
the Chief’s house since his death; they were in good practice.
All members of the household were in their dirtiest and most
worn-out habiliments; every ornament had been discarded; girdles
of beads had been replaced by belts of twisted rattan, and
weights made of pebbles wrapped in bark-cloth had been substituted
for metal ear-rings; many of the men and some of the
women had smeared themselves with soot from the cooking-pots,
and no one had bathed in the river since the demise of the
Chief, four or five days before. They were certainly repulsive in
appearance. This wailing lasted but a scant five minutes, and
then the women retired, and the men withdrew their hands from
their eyes; of course, not a tear had been shed. With the elasticity
of youth,—for they are all mere children,—they were at
once interested in hearing of the expedition we were about to
make to the summit of a mountain near by, and were laughing
and joking over the Ghosts and Sprites that we were sure to
meet in that mysterious moss-jungle continually shrouded in
mists.</p>

<p>It is the custom among the Berawans to keep a corpse in the
house for several months, varying the length of time in accordance
with the rank or wealth of the deceased; sometimes the
body may have to remain unburied until after the harvest. On
the third or fourth day after death, the body is squeezed into a
large jar, which has been carefully cut apart at its largest diameter,
so that the body does not have to be forced through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
narrow neck. It is in the lower half that the corpse is placed in
a cramped, squatting position; the upper half is then fitted on
tightly, and the crack sealed up with resinous gum. The jar is
then placed in a corner of the veranda, and a pipe of hollow
bamboo is inserted to drain off to the ground below the fluids
resulting from decomposition. It occasionally happens that
gases accumulate inside the jar, and cannot escape through the
tube, owing to a stoppage, and then an explosion follows.</p>

<p>The Berawans believe that shortly after death the spirits of
the dead return from Bulun Matai, to see that their relatives and
friends are displaying the due amount of grief by performing the
proper ceremonies. Should a spirit find that it has been neglected
and forgotten, it curses the culprits, and they become blind, deaf,
or lame. If all has been done to show befitting grief and respect,—if
the mourners have been on a raid and secured a nice head
wherewith to decorate the grave or the household hearth,—then
the spirit retires to the nether world, never again to return.</p>

<p>In former days, on the death of any influential Chief, if his
people were either too lazy or too cowardly to go head-hunting,
a male or female slave was purchased and sacrificed in honor of
the dead. From near and far, friends were invited to take part
in the high ceremony. When the poor wretch of a slave was
thrust into a cage of bamboo and rattan, he knew perfectly well
the death by torture to which he was destined. In this cage he
was confined for a week or more, until all the guests had assembled
and a feast was prepared. On the appointed day, after
every one had feasted and a blood-thirsty instinct had been
stimulated to a high pitch by arrack, each one in turn thrust a
spear into the slave. No one was allowed to give a fatal thrust
until every one to the last man had felt the delight of drawing
blood from living, human flesh. We were told by the Berawans
that the slaves often survived six or seven hundred wounds, until
death from loss of blood set them free. The corpse of the victim
was then taken to the grave of the Chief, and the head cut off
and placed on a pole overhanging the grave. Frequently, some
of the guests worked themselves into such a blood-thirsty frenzy
that they bit pieces from the body, and were vehemently applauded
when they swallowed the raw morsel at a gulp.</p>

<p>It is, probably, in conformity with the same idea of a head-hunt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
in honor of the memory of the deceased, that the tribe of
Malanaus, on their return from a burial, engage in a mock battle
with those who remained behind to guard the house, and throw
at them mud and imitation javelins made of light pith.</p>

<p>The body of Aban Liah, although a Berawan, was not placed
in a jar, but, as I have said, in a coffin, and would be kept in the
house, so they told us, for three months, until the end of the
harvest. The people darkly hinted at the absolute necessity of
their obtaining, at that time, a fresh human head. But Dr. Hose
warned them of the sure consequences following every violation
of the solemn compact and rites of peace which they had just
concluded.</p>

<p>We left them in their grief, and set out on our trip to the
summit of Mt. Dulit, one of the lofty range that forms the watershed
between the Rejang and the Baram Rivers. When we
turned into the little stream that flows down the side of the
mountain, we noticed lying on one of the banks the huge, stately
Durian tree, (worth a livelihood to a whole household on account
of its much-prized fruit,) which had been already cut down just to
make a monumental support for the coffin of the good-for-nothing
old Aban Liah. The giant pole was to be elaborately carved and
painted, and, when the Chief’s body was ready to be placed in
position, this huge trunk would be erected near the bank of the
river, a little below his house.</p>

<p>Whatever might have been its origin, it is not now easy to
determine what emotion it is which prompts the Borneans to decorate
elaborately the depositories of their dead; at first glance, it
seems as if it must be affectionate remembrance and a devotion
to the habitation of the soul even after the soul has left it. But,
certainly among the Borneans, demonstrative affection is, I should
say, an exceedingly rare trait; their lives are almost as purely
individual and selfish as are the examples Nature sets before
them at every turn in the jungle. During the time that a child
is still nursing at the mother’s breast, there is that instinctive,
protective parental affection observable in all mating animals;
but after the child is weaned and is able to toddle, it is allowed
to ramble pretty much where it will, and to take its educational
bumps and tumbles without parental worry. Mother Nature provides
the only clothes it wears, and, after her own healing, scarifying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
fashion, darns and patches the rents and tears that they
may receive. Among the young boys and girls there is a sort
of playmate affection, whenever self-sacrifice is not necessary,
and where the one who plans the game or sport always expects
to be and is the principal player. Between adults, be they the
nearest of kin or be they even lovers, I think I am safe in saying
that there is no such thing as unselfish love; a youth would
never think of resigning a comfortable place in a boat to his father,
or to his mother, or to his sister, or even to his sweetheart.
When a man comes back from a long, and perhaps dangerous,
expedition, he does not fall into the arms of his family amid tears
of joy and welcome; but he walks up the notched log and stalks
along the public veranda, looking neither to the right nor to the
left until he deposits his burden opposite his own door, and there
he sits down, lights a cigarette, and tries to act and look as if he
had just come in from the rice-field after a day’s work.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> There
is not a greeting of any kind whatsoever exchanged on either
side; but after a while, and little by little, an admiring group of
men and boys gather round, and slowly he unbends, telling scraps
of news about friends or foes in the country whence he is come,
until at last he is haranguing the people and acting ‘Sir Oracle’
in the centre of a circle of gaping mouths and unwinking eyes.
It is the same were he about to start off on an expedition; no
kerchiefs are waved to him nor do eyes stream with tears as his
canoe pushes off from the shore; he goes down to the boat with
his parcels in just the same matter-of-fact manner as if he were
only going to cross the river for fire-wood. I have seen Bornean
mothers, fathers, and sweethearts, part from those who ought to
have been dear to them, and who were about to set out on distant
expeditions of a peaceful nature, or on long war expeditions
of a dangerous nature, but I remember only one solitary instance
where there were any tears or the slightest show of reluctance
at parting; that one instance was the parting of a sister from a
brother who had come over on a visit to the house into which
she had married quite recently. The woman in this case did
really show a downright love for her snaggle-toothed and hideous
brother; she hung upon his neck, sobbing and wailing, trying
her best to hold him back, and pleading with him not to go; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
patted her on the shoulder, seemed very self-conscious and exceedingly
bored; finally, extricating himself rather rudely from
her arms, he stalked toward the notched log and descended,
looking straight in front of him. Possibly it was, on the woman’s
part, more homesickness than love for her brother. From the
Arctics to the Tropics, be it ever so humdrum, there’s no place
like home.</p>

HOLLOWED OUT AT THE UPPER END OF THE COLUMN AND COVERED OVER
WITH A LARGE TRIANGULAR SLAB OF WOOD, CUT FROM THE ROOT OF A BUTTRESS
TREE. THE ORNAMENTATION IS COMPOSED OF WHITE CHINA BOWLS
AND PLATES, FASTENED ON WITH GUTTA-PERCHA</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Among certain tribes, the body of a Chief swathed in cloths
is placed within the upper end of a tree trunk hollowed out for
the purpose, and a large slab of wood cut from a ‘buttress tree’
is fastened on top. The photograph, on the opposite page, is
that of the grave of a Chief’s wife, and I am sure that in its
erection and ornamentation no jot of affection was felt by the
husband, Temangang Lawi, than whom no more heartless old
head-hunter, and slayer of women and children, exists in Borneo.
His only idea in spending so much time and money on the grave
of his wife was his own glorification. The white spots on the
column are china bowls and saucers stuck on with damar gum;
the flags and streamers on top are strips of white and red cloth,
possibly to keep off birds of prey; possibly a remnant of the
Mongolian idea that anything moving and fluttering in the wind
attracts or distracts the attention of the Spirits.</p>

<p>Again, other tribes enclose their dead in coffins which are
placed in miniature houses on the top of high poles, sometimes
on single poles, again on two or even four poles. These little
houses are decorated with open-work carving along the ridge-pole
and down the angles of the roof, and with painting on the
sides. Not infrequently small wooden figures of men are placed
standing on the roof or climbing up the poles; possibly, these are
effigies of the slaves which in former times were sacrificed at the
burial.</p>

<p>Natural surroundings and the habitations of the living have,
of course, a great influence on the methods of disposing of the
dead. In mountainous, stony districts, the primitive form of
burial is apt to be in cairns or in caves; in lowlands, where land
is swampy, burial in trees, out of the way of beasts of prey, is
adopted. In those districts of Borneo where the jungle is so
dense that it is well-nigh impossible to dig a grave through the
impenetrable, interlocking roots of trees, a burial on poles follows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
of necessity. Where the river-banks are constantly changing
with every freshet, burial in such soft soil would not be permanent.
I think, therefore, that it is more than likely that burial on
high pedestals was, in the first instance, a result of natural surroundings,
and the elaborate decorations are for the glorification
of the living, and not for the dead. In Borneo, there are no
carnivorous animals to dig up bodies, but it is by no means
unknown that men exceedingly anxious to win admiration as
head-hunters obtain from graves the coveted prize, be it of
friend or of foe; therefore, the more inaccessible the body, the
less is the likelihood that the market for heads will become over-stocked.
In the Naga Hills of Eastern Assam, where the natives
live in communities much like the Borneans, some of the tribes
bury their dead in the village streets; others dig graves just outside
the door of the house, or, when the body is perhaps that
of a young unmarried girl or a child, the grave is made even
inside the door. There was I acknowledge, much pathos in the
explanation once given to me by a Naga, whose child was buried
inside his house, that if his little girl were buried out in the jungle
or under the open sky, she would be ‘very much frightened at
night.’ The simple and unostentatious mounds made by the
Nagas over their dead, bear more evidence, I think, of their
affection than do the gaudily decorated tombs erected by the
tribes of Borneo, and yet in their daily lives the Nagas are not
one whit more demonstrative than the Borneans.</p>

<p>When, after two days of hard climbing through virgin jungle,
we reached the topmost peak of Dulit, which is almost exactly
five thousand feet high, dense clouds shut off our view of the
valley below, but the last rays of the sun were slanting through
endless aisles and marvellous recesses of emerald moss, and
from far below, and beneath the clouds, came the dull booming
of a deep-toned tawak from the house of the dead Aban Liah,
announcing fresh mourners at his coffin.</p>

<p>The great Peace-party had at least brought peace to that
scheming, turbulent old soul, whose body now rests in the valley
of the Tinjar.</p>

</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the third day of our journey up the
Baram, to visit Tama Bulan, far in the interior of Borneo, we
stopped at a long-house, and as I saw the women descend on
their errand to the river for water I was utterly amazed at their
costume, and rubbed my eyes to make sure I was not dreaming.
I looked and rubbed, and rubbed and looked! It was no illusion!
The women who were descending the long notched logs to the
river’s edge wore on their thighs and legs beautiful blue silk
<i>tricots</i> or ‘tights,’ of an elaborate open-work pattern! and on
their hands and forearms delicate black silk mits! I was not
prepared for this elegant toilette in the Jungle, and my bewildering
amazement continued until, on nearer inspection, I found
that the airy tracery which I had mistaken for silken tights was
tattooing.</p>

<p>I will not enter on any discussion of the origin or purpose of
tattooing:—whether or not it began in the mark which God set
on Cain after the killing of Abel, or as to its religious, or tribal,
or social purposes, but will simply set forth the customs in regard
to it as I observed them among the Kayans and Kenyahs, the
patterns, and the mode of performing it. Inasmuch as the details
will be dry and extremely uninteresting, and, in reference to the
patterns, given with minuteness, because these patterns are in
their general features almost immutable and are supposed to be
symbolic, I would advise my readers to skip the following pages,
and examine only the photographs, merely premising that,
since Nature has inscribed at the entrance to the Torrid Zone,
‘All clothes abandon, ye who enter here,’ I fancy no one will
dispute that, as a substitution for clothes, pervasive tattooing
provides a device both attractive and modest.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>BATU—YOUNGEST SON OF THE KAYAN CHIEF OYONG LUHAT.</p>

<p class="caption2">HIS TATTOOING IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE KAYANS OF THE BARAM DISTRICT,
EXCEPT THAT HIS HANDS DO NOT BEAR THE MARKS DENOTING A
SUCCESSFUL HEAD-HUNTER; THE TIGER-CAT’S TEETH IN HIS EARS SHOW,
HOWEVER, THAT HE HAS BEEN ON HEAD-HUNTING EXPEDITIONS AND HAS
ATTAINED THE RANK OF A WARRIOR. AFTER THE EAR HAS BEEN STRETCHED
TO THE DESIRED LENGTH, ONE SMALL COPPER RING IS USUALLY ALL THAT
IS WORN, MERELY TO KEEP THE LOBE FROM CONTRACTING. THE BANDS
BELOW HIS KNEES ARE OF FINELY BRAIDED FERN-ROOT, AND ARE KNOWN
AS ‘UNUS’; OCCASIONALLY THEY ARE OF STRIPS OF RATTAN BOUND WITH
BRASS WIRE. UNUS ARE UNIVERSALLY WORN BY THE MEN, AND THEY
THINK THAT WITHOUT THEM A MAN LOOKS EXCEEDINGLY NAKED.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The tattoo-marks on the Kayan men are small in size, and
confined to certain portions of the body. There are only four or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
five, and they are placed on the thighs either in front, below
the groin, or on the outer surface, just below the hip-joint, and
on the flexor surface of the forearm. The designs consist of
extremely conventionalised representations of ‘dogs,’ ‘scorpions,’
and the ‘head of a prawn;’ these are the native names given to
the different patterns; in none of them is it possible to recognise
the animal after which it is named.</p>

<p>Professor Alfred C. Haddon, whose opinion commands all
respect, has expressed to me the extremely ingenious explanation,
that, notwithstanding the native names, all these patterns represent
the head of a dog. To this I modestly and most humbly demur,
and incline to the belief that it is rather the head of that animal
which enters so largely into all their ceremonials, namely, the
pig. Dogs, on the other hand, are treated by all Borneans uniformly
with great contempt. It may be noted, furthermore, that
this same pattern, whatever be its origin, enters into all Kayan
decoration, whether of doors, of beams, of implements, of bead-work,
or of graves.</p>

<p>The patterns are selected purely according to fancy, and, as
far as I could ascertain, serve solely as personal embellishment.
The only mark which is really a male distinction is placed on
the back of the hands and fingers after a man has taken a head.
The designs on the hands of these men are always very indistinct,
owing to the constant exposure and rough treatment to which
the tattooing is necessarily subjected before it is thoroughly
healed; hence the lines become faint and merge into one another,
so that the appearance of a head-hunter’s hands reminds one
forcibly of Edward Lear’s nonsensical Jumblies, whose ‘heads
were green and their hands were blue, and they went to sea in a
sieve.’ I never saw a head-hunter’s hands that were freshly
tattooed, nor did I ever see the stamps wherewith these designs
are marked out. I am, therefore, unable to give a description of
these important marks further than that the backs of the hands
appear to be covered with narrow parallel lines running transversely,
and the knuckles and their interspaces are covered with
triangles with base and apex alternating; on the joints of the
fingers are oblong patches of solid black.</p>

<p>The tattooing on the men, except, of course, the badge of a
head-hunter, is done at about the age of puberty. It is not at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
all a ceremony; the youth himself decides when it shall be done
and selects the pattern. In many tribes allied to the Kayans, in
the Dutch possessions in South Borneo, some of the men are
far more elaborately tattooed than the Kayans and Kenyahs
of Sarawak, and extend the tattooing to the chest and back, and
even to the cheeks and neck; but these elaborately tattooed men
are the exceptions and not the rule in their tribe, and the marks
are by no means as characteristic as are the ‘dog,’ ‘scorpion,’
and ‘prawn’ of the Baram Kayans. The Dayaks, or, properly
speaking, the Ibans (the name <i>Dayak</i> is a mere Malay name,
meaning ‘up-river people,’ and never used by the natives themselves
to whom it is applied) tattoo on the wrists, forearms,
chest, neck, and thighs, but never in large designs. On the
chest, and on the point of the shoulder, they bear many-pointed
stars, with a spiral sometimes double and interlocking in the centre.
On the throat I have often observed narrow zig-zag lines
connecting two designs like the escapement wheel of a watch.
The zig-zag lines, they said, represent chains, but why a chain
should be appropriate for the neck they did not say. The stars
on the chest and shoulder, some maintained, represent flowers;
others said they were silver dollars. With the exception of the
few links of chain on the front of the throat, they do not seem to
aim at the representation of ornaments, such as necklaces, bracelets,
anklets, etc. In addition to these marks on the chest, arms,
and neck, a very common position for a small design is directly
on the prominent end of the ulna at the wrist; almost every Iban
has over this prominence a small star, or a wheel-like design, with
radii extending beyond the circumference.</p>

<p>Far more elaborate, on the contrary, is the tattooing of Kayan
women, which, in the case of married women, invariably covers the
thighs, legs, forearms, hands, and feet.</p>

<p>On the arms, it extends from the second joint of the fingers,
(whereon is a simple black patch about a half inch square,) to
just a little below the bend of the elbow. The knuckles and
intervening hollows are decorated with a row of solid black
triangles with base and point alternating; on the back of the
hand are four small ovals surrounded by five concentric ovals,
the outer four merging into the contiguous series, so that the
upper and lower arcs form merely wavy lines. This row of concentric<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
ovals is enclosed in a border of five lines, following the
margin of the back of the hand below the knuckles to the wrist.</p>

<p>On the back of the wrist is another row of four concentric
ovals; above these, nine narrow lines and then two rows of five
concentric ovals alternating with bands composed of five narrow
lines. Above these, again, are intertwining zig-zags and scrolls
composed of seven lines; this pattern, they told me, represents
the root of the Tuba-plant, which is used in drugging, or poisoning,
the water to get fish. The concentric ovals, so they say, are
pictures of the moon. It is barely possible that an explanation
of this frequent figure of the moon is to be found in a remark
made to me by a tattooer, that when a woman died and passed to
the next life, ‘her tattooing becomes luminous like a fire-fly’s
light, and that without it she would wander in total darkness.’
Above the Tuba pattern are eleven, sometimes more, finely
waving lines completely encircling the arm, like rings. From
these rings to the wrist, along both sides of the arm, is a narrow
recurrent line making four laps on itself, and dividing the
patterns on the flexor and extensor surfaces of the arm.</p>

<p>On the flexor surface of the arm, the pattern begins at the
wrist with a row of triangles like those on the knuckles; then a
band of narrow lines and two large concentric moons; above
these, a large triangle whose sides and base are composed of
seven narrow, parallel lines,—this represents the spring bow-piece,
affixed to a canoe when shooting rapids; above this, two
more large moons and then the band of rings around the arm.</p>

<p>These patterns vary to a slight extent in different households,
but the main features are always present; the concentric ovals
may be replaced by a spiral coil surrounded by radiating lines;
or the twists and zig-zags of the Tuba-root may be arranged
according to the artistic ability of the operator. The concentric
moons are, however, considered a higher grade of work than
the spiral coils.</p>

<p>The pattern on the thighs extends externally from the level
of the hip-joint to the calf of the leg; it consists of four panels,
each enclosed in a border of five delicate and parallel lines. At
the top of these panels are conventionalised designs of ‘scorpions,’
of ‘dogs,’ or of the ‘heads of prawns;’ at least they closely
resemble these patterns in the tattooing of the men. Beneath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
these, are small Tuba-root designs, and then a chain of interlocking
diamonds, whereof the smaller and underlying diamonds
have their vertical apices terminating in little hooks and curves;
these, they assert, represent a creeping vine with hooked tendrils,
like many of the palms and rattans. Round the calf is a series
of rings, sixteen, more or less, in number, which completely
encircle the leg like the rings on the forearm. Directly down
the back of the thigh, from the fold of the gluteus muscle to the
rings on the calf of the leg, a strip about an inch wide is left
blank; this is an invariable feature, but they could give me no
explicit explanation of its meaning. Dr. Hose expressed to me
his belief that the natives considered this space to be necessary
in order that the ‘blood might run up and down.’ On several
occasions I tried to verify this interesting explanation, sedulously
avoiding all leading questions, but always failed to elicit satisfactory
answers. It would be remarkable should it prove that they
knew anything about the circulation of the blood. As far as my
observation goes, even the most experienced old Dayong, who,
as an <i>haruspex</i>, must cut up, yearly, hundreds of pigs and fowls
and examine their internal organs, has not the slightest accurate
knowledge of the function of any organ, not even of the heart.
By one tattooer I was assured that if this space were not left
unmolested the leg would swell excessively and the tattooing
prove a failure. It is not impossible that she had herein found
the true reason for this ‘safety valve,’ as it were, of healthy skin.
When a limb is girdled with tattooing, done under such septic
conditions as always obtain in Borneo, the inflammation and
swelling are very considerable; the skin becomes tense and non-elastic,
and if there be no healthy area of elastic skin whereby to
relieve tension, consequences might prove serious.</p>

<p>The markings on the feet are plain, broad stripes running from
the bend of the ankle in front, over the dorsum of the foot,
following the metatarsal bones to the toes; these stripes are
interrupted once, dividing off the upper third over the instep.
There is also an oblong patch of black on the second joint of
each toe.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>TATTOOING ON THE FOREARMS AND FEET OF A KENYAH WOMAN.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The persistence of the Tuba-root design in all of these
patterns is, possibly, due to the fact that Tuba-fishing is considered
more or less a feminine sport, although men participate in it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
and do the greater part of the work; nevertheless, it is the
only sport wherein women join, and it is always a picnic and
jollification.</p>

<p>The conjecture may be hazarded that the bands of rings close
to the elbow and around the calf of the leg may possibly represent
the ‘Unus,’ or rings of braided fern-root, worn by men and
boys. The wavy lines look much like the impressions which
these narrow braids make in the skin.</p>

<p>The tattooing of girls is begun when they are about four
or five years old; the fingers and toes and knuckles are then
decorated with the squares and the triangles, but here the process
ceases until the girls become of marriageable age, when the
tattooing of arms, and next of legs, is completed.</p>

<p>In connection with the operation of tattooing (which, by the
way, they call ‘Bityek,’—a disyllabic <i>Bit-yek</i>), there seems to be
no particular lali or taboo; no objection to spectators was ever
made either by the operator or by the patient; nor at being photographed
was there shown any more than the usual reluctance.</p>

<p>As an indispensable preliminary, before the skin is touched,
several beads must be given to the operator, who may not keep
them all, but must hand over some to the ‘Toh,’—the demons
who are always lurking about to see that the rules of the house
are obeyed. It is lali to draw human blood in a house unless
the Toh be previously informed that it is for a lawful purpose.
Some of the beads are, therefore, flung broadcast out of doors,
for the Toh to gather up at their leisure. The girl is put on no
special diet while undergoing the operation.</p>

<p>All tattooing is done by women, (be it remembered that I am
here speaking only of the Kayans,) who, as far as I could ascertain,
have no privileged position in the community, nor is any
qualification demanded of them other than artistic taste and
manual skill. The office is not hereditary, although it often happens
that the profession descends from mother to daughter,
merely because the daughter from an early age is employed as
an assistant, and thereby acquires a familiarity with the process,
and naturally inherits her mother’s instruments.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Kayan Tattooing Instrument.

</figure>

<p>The pattern to be tattooed is marked out on the skin by
means of wooden stamps whereon the raised patterns have been
carved out, leaving the designs in high relief; these stamps are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
inked and pressed on the skin, leaving a print which sufficiently
guides the operator. For tattooing, three needles are bound
tightly together, and inasmuch as it is
considered advisable to force them obliquely
into the skin, they are inserted
slightly slantwise in the head of the
wooden holder (shaped somewhat like
a hammer), and enveloped in gutta-percha
to about an eighth of an inch
from their points, which holds them
firmly in place and regulates the depth
to which they may penetrate the skin.
Not infrequently the handle and the
head of the needle-holder are ornamented
with carving.</p>

<p>The ink is made of the juice of
sugar-cane, thickened with the soot of
damar gum; it is kept in a bowl of
soft wood, wherein the needles can be
dipped without dulling the points; and
finally the operator provides several
pieces of soft bark-cloth for wiping
away the blood, which flows profusely.
All these instruments are usually kept
in a cob-webby, sooty, blood-smeared
box; but as heirlooms and tools they
are of almost priceless value.</p>

<p>During the operation the girl sits or
lies upon the floor; beside her squats
the operator, with her toes pressing
upon the skin to be tattooed; an assistant
on the opposite side keeps the skin
stretched. At the edge of the design
marked out by the wooden stamp is
placed a roll of soft bark-cloth, so
thick that when the handle of the
needle-holder rests upon it the needles
exactly touch the skin. The needles, well dipped in the ink,
carry enough fluid to tattoo lines several inches in length. Using<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
the roll of cloth as a rest, the operator follows out the design
and punctures the skin to a proper and uniform depth by
means of quick taps with a small iron rod on that portion of the
handle which rests on the roll. The assistant, following the track
of the needles, wipes away superfluous ink and blood. (<i>Experto
crede</i>, when I say that the pain of the Kayan operation, even for
small designs, is very considerable; when endured for more than
an hour, it becomes torture. Having also experienced for many
consecutive hours the Japanese method, I can affirm that in comparison
the Kayan verges on the inhuman.) A roll of bark-cloth
or a stick is held by the victim, and, as an anæsthetic during
the operation, clutched with desperate strength. (The photograph
herewith given necessarily had to be taken in a very
dark room. A magnifying glass will greatly assist an examination
of the details.)</p>

<p>Of course, the complete pattern on women is never finished
at one sitting; it would involve more suffering than can be borne
without, perhaps, serious shock; but the martyrdom is often endured
for a couple of hours, and then, to fill in chance gaps and
weak places, that which has been already pricked in, and is
become an exquisitely tender welt, is mercilessly jabbed and
hammered over again, not only once but even twice. The instant
that the poor wretch of a girl is released from the hands, and
toes, of her tormentor, she runs with the swiftness of agony to
the river, there to soothe with the cool flowing water the frightful,
burning ache. The absorption of so much foreign matter by
the lymphatics often induces high fever; suppuration also not
infrequently results from the septic manner in which the operation
is performed; this naturally injures the sharpness of the
lines. After one session, the tattooing is not resumed until the
skin is entirely healed, unless an approaching marriage necessitates
the utmost speed; should a woman have a child before her
tattooing is completed, she is lastingly disgraced. The Kenyah
women are tattooed only on the forearms and hands and on the
dorsum of the foot, not on the legs or thighs.</p>

<p>Woe worth the behests of Bornean fashion! Tattooing is not
the only torture that the Kayan or Kenyah damsel must endure
who would fain be a belle; her ear-lobes must be pierced and
stretched with weights until they hang down to her very bosom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
in long, slim loops of skin. One evening, in Tama Bulan’s house,
I was entertaining his daughter, Bulan, with the pictures in some
illustrated papers that I had brought with me, and was trying my
best (my fluency in Malay, at that time, was limited) to make
them intelligible to her. As I have mentioned above, she was
filled with boundless amazement at the slim and wasp-like waists
of the women, and utterly failed to understand how any woman
could endure the hourly suffering entailed by being horribly
squeezed in by steel bands, which, I managed to tell her, were
the secret of the extraordinary and unnatural shape. But while
in the very act of gazing and marvelling at these pictures of
what rational human beings will suffer in order to appear more
beautiful, she was herself constantly relieving her poor, elongated
ear-lobes of the several pounds weight of copper rings dangling
and clinking on her shoulders, by sustaining in her hands, if
only for a brief moment, these monstrous demands of Bornean
fashion.</p>

<p>With a prophetic eye to future charms, they begin early.
The ear-lobes are slit when a baby is two or three days old, and
as soon as ever the cuts are sufficiently healed several small
pewter rings are inserted, and gradually increased in number
until their weight amounts to five or six ounces, and by the
end of the first year the lobe has been lengthened three or four
inches.</p>

<p>This gradual increase of weights is kept up with girls until
the lobe stretches seven or eight inches. I have seen many a
loop of skin, thus formed, sufficiently large and elastic to allow it
to be slipped over the head.</p>

<p>It is by no means uncommon to see women with as many as
three pounds of copper rings dangling in their ears; of course,
this precludes all rapid motion unless the weights are supported
by the hands. When they stoop over their work the rings are
tossed behind on the back.</p>

<p>It often happens that the weights in the ears are increased
injudiciously, and the thin band of skin gives way; it may be
that the loop catches on a twig in the jungle or on some projection
in the house, and, in a minute, all the long years of suffering
have been in vain; immaculate beauty is for ever gone. To be
sure, the ends may be spliced by instantly binding them fast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
together; but an ugly, tell-tale lump is the result, and nevermore
are the two ears of a symmetrical, lovely length, and nevermore
can they, like John Gilpin’s bottles, ‘keep the balance true’ by
bearing equal weights of copper rings. The patched lobe
remains the weaker.</p>

<p>The women of the Berawan tribe, instead of weights, insert
discs of wood three or four inches in diameter, often carved on
both sides in delicate star-shaped patterns, and sometimes
brightened by bits of colored glass or mirrors inlaid in the
centre.</p>

<p>The Kayan and Kenyah men never stretch their ear-lobes to
the same length as do the women; it is effeminate in a man to
have his ears depend further than just to graze the shoulder.
Men seldom wear more than one small copper ring, which is
heavy enough merely to keep the loop taut.</p>

<p>The men of these same tribes, although they escape from
extreme length of ears, must endure a second mutilation of this
appendage. But this time it is in the upper part that a hole is
punched, wherein, when they attain to full manhood and have
been on a war expedition, there is inserted a tiger-cat’s canine
tooth decorated at the large end with a tuft of bead-work, or a
silver cap, to keep it in place. Before they are entitled to this
adornment, the hole, at least half an inch in diameter, is kept
open by a simple wooden plug, which is generally worn, even by
warriors, except on ceremonial occasions, and especially when in
mourning for the dead.</p>

<p>These holes for the tiger-cat’s tooth are not punched at the
same time that the lobe is slit; the operation is not performed
until the boy is about ten years old. The best time for it, so
they claim, is in the evening; the wounds then have the benefit
of the quiet, cool night, whereby the pain and chance of severe
inflammation are notably lessened. A very opportune occasion
is during a war expedition, when quietude and idleness are the
rule, frequently for days, while the seers are finding the Omen
Birds, and consulting them as to the success of the expedition.
Young boys always accompany head-hunting raids, and serve in
all menial capacities, such as, baling out the boats, collecting
wood, starting the fires, etc. Inspired by the excitement of the
hour, they are more than willing to undergo the pain of having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
their ears punched, in anticipation of the respect with which they
will be regarded by their playmates when they return.</p>

<p>The operation is never performed unless the boy has had an
auspicious dream the night before. It is auspicious to dream of
bathing in clear, cold water, or of fruit trees laden with fruit, or
of fish in large schools. It would be absolutely prohibitory of
all thought of the operation were the lad to dream of fire or of
eating anything hot, such as chillies or wild pepper. To make
ready for the operation, the boy stands against a tree or post, so
that the back of his ear stands out from his head with the firm
support of the wood behind it; the hole is then punched out with
a cylinder of bamboo of the proper half-inch size, which has been
sharpened round the edge so that it makes a clean cut when
driven by a smart blow from a billet of wood.</p>

<p>In the hole a plug of wood is at once inserted, and there
remains until the wound is healed. The poor little chaps suffer
horribly from the swelling and inflammation that always ensue.
But have they not advanced the first step toward that happy
day when they may be so blest as to kill a foe, and ever after
entitled to wear a tiger-cat’s tooth?</p>

<p>It was not until I saw the women of Tama Bulan’s household
dressed out in all their very best during the ceremonies of The
Naming of the son and heir, that I noticed that they, too, had
the upper part of the ear pierced for the insertion of a small
tassel of beads. The hole is very small, and lies concealed in
the fold of skin at the margin of the outer ear.</p>

<p>The Ibans do not stretch the ear-lobes more than an inch or
two; but they make up for it by puncturing the edge of the
outer ear in a series of small holes about an eighth of an inch
apart, extending from the lobe all round the ear to where it joins
with the skin of the head. In these diminutive holes they insert
either a series of small white-metal rings or an elaborate ornament
of open brass rings, either plain or strung with cowrie
shells, and connected, opposite the opening whereby they are
slipped into the holes in the ear, with a narrow band of brass,
from which are suspended many small diamond-shaped pieces
of the same metal, which clink and jingle and glitter. The
rings at the top of the ear are about half an inch in diameter,
but they increase gradually in size until at the lobe they are an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
inch or more. When an Iban is bedizened with these aural
adornments, and has a red and yellow cloth wound around his
head, and ten yards of Turkey-red calico tied and twined about
his waist, elegance of Iban costume can no further go.</p>

</figure>

<p>In the way of improving nature, there is yet a third form of
cosmetical adornment in which, it is safe to say, almost every tribe
in Borneo indulges, namely, blackening the teeth. White teeth
are universally considered frightful disfigurements, and he or she,
who for a few days neglects to renew the stain, is sure to be jeered
at by all companions with the scoffing remark that white teeth
are no better than a dog’s. I have had that reproach cast at me
many a time by little children. The staining is effected with a
paste made of a greyish-black shale rock, called ‘Tunai,’ powdered
very fine and mixed with water and the ashes of a wood,
which probably contains a considerable quantity of gallic or of
tannic acid; two or three applications of this paste impart to the
teeth a brilliant, shining black, which color remains for several
days, and then must be renewed by fresh applications.</p>

<p>The Ibans use a mixture of the ashes of cocoanut husks and
of a wood, known to them as ‘Garang,’ and the burnt juice of a
green rattan. This mixture produces the same evenly tinted
black as the Tunai stone.</p>

<p>Incomprehensible as it may seem, a row of regular, well-shaped
teeth of inky jet is not devoid of charm; at a distance,
I admit, the mouth looks cavernous, but near enough to distinguish
the teeth at all, I venture to say it is attractive.</p>

<p>Now comes the fourth mandate of fashion, of an ineffably
excruciating character:—</p>

<p>The Ibans, not content with blackening the teeth, actually
drill holes through and through the faces of the six front teeth,
and therein insert plugs of brass, whereof the outer end is elaborated
into stars and crescents. Then they finish up by filing the
teeth to sharp points! No dentist’s chair can hold a more
hideous torture than this. The drill,—usually no more delicate
an instrument than the rounded end of a file,—bores directly
through the sensitive pulp of the tooth, tearing and twisting a
nerve so exquisitely sensitive that but to touch it starts the perspiration
and seems the limit of human endurance; yet an Iban
will lie serene and unquivering on the floor while his beauty is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
thus enhanced by some kind and tender-hearted friend. Of
course, the tooth dies and becomes a mere shell, tanned inside
and out by repeated applications of the astringent blackening;
the gums recede, exposing the fangs of the teeth and sometimes
portions of the alveolar process,—I need not add that the mouth
of a middle-aged Iban is anything but attractive.</p>

<p>The brass plugs can be inserted or removed at will. When
a young Iban lad whom I took with me as a servant to Singapore
and Siam, noticed that the people in the streets stared at
his bestudded teeth, he at once removed the brass studs and
kept them carefully locked up in his private box.</p>

<p>For a fifth time Nature and the Borneans are at odds:—</p>

<p>Nature’s beneficent provisions of eyelashes, eyebrows, beard,
and moustache are all disdained, and plucked incontinently away.
On the score of beauty, I draw the line at blackened teeth. The
depilation of eyebrows and eyelashes is a backward step, and
mars every face subjected to it, and is the cause, naturally
enough, of much discomfort, if not of actual disease. At almost
every house where we stopped we were called upon to treat cases
of severe conjunctivitis, for which we could find no more reasonable
cause than that it was due to the irritation caused by the
depilation of eyelashes, coupled with bathing in muddy water.
Furthermore, the absence of the slight shade given by the eyelashes
in the glare of the sun seemed to me to be the cause of
that anxious, distressed expression, or of a fierce and wild scowl,
observable on so many faces. The moustache is very seldom
allowed to grow, except on one side, and then only in a tuft at
the corner of the mouth. The beard likewise is usually limited
to a few straggling hairs on one side of the chin.</p>

<p>There is a certain tribe,—the Malanaus,—among whom the
custom obtains of flattening the foreheads of female children;
the practice is begun about the fifteenth day after birth, and continues
for several months, until the bones of the skull begin to
harden. The process is as follows:—On the forehead of the
child a small padded board is held in place by means of cords,
which pass through its ends and are attached to a band of cloth
which passes round the back of the child’s head. On the upper
surface of the board the cords pass through a perforated coin,
one from above downward and the other from below upward, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
that by turning the coin the cords are twisted and the band
shortened. By this means the pressure is exerted regularly by
just so many turns of the coin each day. The compression is
applied only during sleep, and, unless very carefully done, there
is danger lest under too great pressure the skull be forced apart
at the fontanelles. The Malanaus maintain that a forehead thus
flattened imparts to the face a very beautiful and mild expression.
Inasmuch as this compression is restricted to very early infancy,
I am inclined to think that the skull resumes its shape. I did not
observe any deformity of the foreheads in adults or even in the
young girls.</p>

</figure>

<p>None of the tribes mutilates the nose either with rings or sticks
through the septum, or with studs through the alæ. Nor do
they ornament themselves with scars, except as practised by the
boys to show their fortitude. In this display of valour, they have
adopted a species of moxa,—small pieces of tinder are placed
along the forearm, set on fire, and allowed to burn out undisturbed
by any sign whatever of pain. The straight line of scars
bears an enduring testimony to the fortitude of the youth, and
is infinitely precious in the eyes and to the heart of his dusky
love.</p>

<p>What with browless and lashless eyes, inky teeth, brass plugs,
looped ears, and blue legs, I am afraid I have given but a sorry
picture of those whom I would fain have my readers regard with
as much kindliness as my memory now holds for the originals.
These freaks of fashion are, however, merely external; underneath
I found honesty, hospitality, gentleness, and a child-like
simplicity. The Kayans and Kenyans harmonise with their surroundings.
The very word ‘jungle’ possesses an indefinable
charm,—it is full of gay, exuberant life in insect and flower; but
in its depth, side by side with these, lurks swift death. Deep
seated in the heart of the joyous, child-like Borneans there
reigns in their bosoms, true to their jungle home, an inextinguishable
yearning for a head not their own. Nevertheless, I
like them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PERMANTONG_OR_LALI"><i>PERMANTONG, OR LALI</i><br>
<i>A BORNEAN SPECIES OF TABOO</i></h2>

</div>

<p>During the days devoted to search for omens in reference
to the sites of the rice-fields, and also again in reference to the
planting, the Kayans refrain from their usual daily occupations,
and neither leave their houses themselves nor allow strangers to
enter. These days of seclusion are termed ‘Permantong Padi,’
or ‘Lali Padi,’ and correspond very closely to taboo elsewhere.
Permantong is the word among the Kayans in the Baram district
in the northwest of the island; but among the Kayans in the
valley of the Kapuas River, in Dutch Borneo, it is ‘Pantang;’
both these forms are possibly derived from the Malay word
‘Hantu,’—a Demon or evil Spirit,—with the prefix <i>per</i> and
the affix <i>an</i>, both used to form derivative substantives; thus the
Malay word in full would be ‘per-hantu-an,’ meaning <i>possessed
by Spirits</i>, or, more freely, <i>bewitched</i>. ‘Lali’ is probably a pure
Kayan word; its derivation I do not know. Between it and
permantong I could discover no shade of difference in meaning.</p>

<p>The work of clearing off the jungle is tedious in the extreme,
and, if after all the heavy labour, the crops should fail or be
destroyed by monkeys, or by birds, or by a beetle called ‘pangau,’
or by blight, the whole household in their discouragement
become convinced that they have committed some act to incur
the displeasure of the Spirits; therefore, before this arduous work
is begun, it is of prime importance to ascertain the exact temper
of the Spirits, by observing the actions of certain birds, mammals,
and reptiles, all of which are known to the Kayans as ‘Amau,’
and are supposed to be in the confidence of the unseen Powers.
It needs but a close observation of bird, beast, and snake to
detect the supernal favourable or unfavourable dispositions.</p>

<p>The experienced husbandmen of the household usually select<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
a patch of jungle, which in their opinion will make a good
rice-field if the Spirits be favourable; then each family does its
share in clearing off the undergrowth.</p>

</figure>

<p>During this preliminary stage, when the labour is not as
severe as when heavy trees must be felled, the household is
not as yet lali; nevertheless, every individual looks out most
anxiously for any evil omens. If, on the way to the clearing, a
snake called ‘Nipa matei ekoh’ (<i>Dead-tailed snake</i>) is encountered,
which has a brilliant red head and a red-tipped tail, or
should any one see a deer called ‘Tela-au’ (<i>Cervulus muntjac</i>), or
a Civet cat (<i>Arctogale leucotis</i>) called ‘Munin,’ or a Rain bird
called by the Kayans ‘Pajan,’ and by the Kenyahs ‘Talajan’
(<i>Platylophus coronatus</i>), they will relinquish the site, and, regardless
of the work already done, abandon the place for ever. These
four animals are most unfavourable omens when seen near the
clearing, and wilfully to disregard their warnings, even at this
early stage, not only compromises the abundance and quality of
the crops, but also the health, or even the life, of the whole
household. Should a man hear a downright warning and yet
pay no attention to it, it is natural enough that during the ensuing
year he should attribute to this disregard, whatever bad luck or
even slight accident might befall him. If on the third day of
work on the clearing, the whistle of the Talajan bird is heard
near by, the omen is favourable; up to this time it is ill-omened,
but now it indicates that the crops will be enormous, and that the
rice-houses or granaries must be made of hard, enduring wood,
to stand the weight of the rice harvest.</p>

<p>If, during three days, no evil omens have been observed, there
is sufficient encouragement therein to proceed to the next stage
of felling the heavy timber, and to incite the entire household to
co-operate in the search for further requisite auguries.</p>

<p>All the families remain secluded in the long veranda, or in
their small private rooms, and sit all day long quite still, smoking
and talking; not a soul is allowed to leave the house, or, at most,
to go further than the bank of the river, except two men designated
as the ‘Laki-Niho,’ (<i>Hawk-men</i>,) whose duty it is to look
for a hawk, called ‘Niho.’</p>

<p>While these Hawk-men are engaged in this search, no one
must call them by their true names; even an accidental infringement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
of this rule is punished by a fine of a few beads, or of a
coarse china plate. It is the custom of some households for the
Laki-Niho not to return to the house during the whole three
days’ search for omens; at such times they build in the jungle,
near the clearing, a small hut, which they indicate to be
permantong, by putting up beside it two poles, called ‘ponkut,’
whereon the bark is stripped into bunches of shavings at intervals
down the pole. While living in this hut, members of their own
household may communicate with them, if urgent necessity
arises, but with strangers, who ought to know from the ponkut,
the serious nature of the permantong, they will hold no communication
whatever.</p>

<p>Should the hawk be seen on the first day of the search, but
not on the two succeeding days, it is unfavourable; nevertheless,
they would continue the preparation of the soil, with the expectation,
however, of poor crops, which, if from no other cause,
would be sure to follow the half-heartedness with which people
work when discouraged at the very outset.</p>

<p>On the second day the search is kept up, and if the hawk be
now seen, it is favourable, but not completely favourable; if they
returned to the house, they would not probably refer to it, lest
their chances for the morrow be thereby jeopardised. But
should they fail to catch sight of the hawk on the third day,
they would accept the omen of the second day, and be fairly
well content; the search must be continued, however, until the
last chance of the most favourable of omens is gone.</p>

<p>If on the third day’s search, the hawk is again observed, the
omen of the second day is rejected, and the omen of the third
day is the only one accepted. A small pile of chips is at once
set on fire, to inform the hawk, that a blessing is expected on their
crops, and the Laki-Niho hurry back to the house to spread the
good news. Every one in the house now lights a cigarette or
waves a fire-brand, whereby a blessing is invoked on his or her
particular rice-farm, and all eagerly watch for the hawk, to see
whether or not he sails around without flapping his wings.
Should he sail away out of sight without once flapping his wings
all are delighted; it means that the clearing of the jungle may
now continue prosperously, and that neither attack of enemies
nor accident to the workers need be feared. Should the hawk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
flap his wings, it follows that some men, in felling the jungle, will
be badly cut by their axes or perhaps crushed under falling trees.
All instantly avert their eyes from the flapping hawk, lest the bird
should recognise them in the fields and select them as victims.
After they have made their wishes known to the hawk by means
of the fire, there is a respite of a day or two in the permantong,
and the people are allowed to go out of doors.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>FIELD OF HILL RICE, CLEARED AND PLANTED BY IBANS IN THE
BARAM DISTRICT.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After this short respite, the same two Laki-Niho again set out,
this time in search of the Talajan bird; and again the people are
housed. This search lasts three days also, and on the third day,
if successful, they perform the same rite as before with fire and
smoke. Next follows a three days’ lookout for the Tela-au deer,
which must be not only seen but heard; if it dart off the minute
it is seen, without giving its gruff bark, it foretells a misfortune,
but to an individual merely, not to the whole household; consequently,
but very little attention comparatively is paid to it.</p>

<p>The tedious formalities are now nearly over, and there remain
but two more animals to be observed, namely, the Munin and the
Makong, (<i>Berenicornis comatus</i>, the white-headed Horn-bill;)
these two, also, must utter some sound to show whether or not
they are favourable. These are all the omens that must be consulted
before the heavy timber can be felled and the rice planted.
During each period of three days, all members of the household
must remain within the house.</p>

<p>When the felled jungle is become dry, it is burned over, and
as soon as the ground is cool they dibble in the grain. From
the hour when the real labour of felling the jungle begins, until
the seed-planting is finished, no stranger is allowed to enter the
house or field; should inadvertence or necessity bring a neighbor
within the lali district, he must pay a small offering to atone for
the trespass. This offering is known as ‘Usut,’ and is ordinarily
a few beads or something of iron, such as a spear-head, or an
old knife. The usut is placed in a basket and hung up in the rice-field
until it rusts away or disappears. To see that this usut is
properly paid, is the duty of the women, who call the custom
‘Toh Lali,’ or Lali of the Spirits. (Once, when on our way
down the river from Tama Bulan’s, we stopped at a house, and,
finding no one about, walked boldly up the bank, whereupon the
head-man hurried down to meet us, and demanded, with considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
persistence, that we should give him a knife. Thinking he
was hinting at a present, I searched in the canoe for one of my
good hunting-knives. On receiving it, he incontinently thrust it
into a basket and sent it off to the rice-fields to be hung up and
to rust away. An old table-knife or any bit of old iron would
have done as well, but my ignorance cost me a valuable knife,
which I am sure was wasted on the Toh.)</p>

<p>The crop is now fairly started. The heaviest part of the task
of keeping down the weeds falls to the women, who rise with
the sun, and, as soon as the household is fairly awake, start off
in rain or shine for the fields, in parties of six or eight, armed
with their little, short-handled, lop-sided hoes. Usually they
do not eat until they arrive at the scene of their labours; sometimes
they halt at a pebbly ‘karangan,’ where dry wood is
plenty, and there break their fast, but do not eat again until
they return to the house in the evening.</p>

<p>Shortly before the rice is cut, a basket containing pieces of
wood, roots, leaves, and strings of beads is carried to the field
and left there for three days. This basket of offerings, or
charms for the crop, is called the ‘Tigga,’ and after the rice is
cut the basket and its contents are placed either on a shelf in
the granaries or else on the platform just outside the door.</p>

<p>During the harvesting of the ‘Parai Agit,’ a small patch of
rice planted first, and always harvested first, there is a lali of four
days, known as the ‘Lamali Parai,’ (lali of the pregnant rice.)
Of the Parai Agit no woman must eat; if she does eat of this
rice, she will go mad. Reiterated questionings failed to disclose
the origin of this belief, and even the reason for planting the
Parai Agit itself.</p>

<p>When the rice is all harvested, the household is lali to
strangers, and for eight days no one can go off on any expedition
nor return to the house from an expedition. No sooner
does this lali end, than another begins, while the rice is being
stored in the granaries. But as soon as this harvesting is over, a
general feast is prepared, and merriment of all sorts makes
up for the weariness of the long day’s work. The women don
every stitch of their finery and every bead to their name; some
even assume men’s clothes, and carry shield, spear, and parang.
In the evening, all join in a long procession round the house;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
guests are invited to participate in the festivities, and ‘jest and
youthful jollity’ rule the hour; the brimming cup passes freely,
and to the harmonious strains of the kaluri the women ‘trip it
as they go,’ or leap in war-dances, in imitation of the men. As a
half apology for all this ‘heart-easing mirth,’ they told me that
this harvest at least was theirs,—they might not live to see
another.</p>

AS ABOUT CAMPHOR, AND WHILE SEARCHING FOR IT THE COLLECTORS ARE
HEDGED IN AT EVERY TURN BY PERMANTONG OR TABOO, AND MUST TALK IN
A LANGUAGE USED ONLY DURING QUESTS FOR THE ELUSIVE CRYSTALS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After this festival there follows another lali, known as the
‘Lali Neboko;’ it lasts for ten long days, and is apparently
devoted by the women to the resumption of their proper sphere
and duties; they make all sorts of cakes out of the new rice, and
vie with each other in devising toothsome dishes for their lovers
and husbands. During all this lali, no one is permitted to do a
stroke of any work that resembles the cultivation of rice; a
parang or a billiong, or any tool used in felling the jungle, is a
strictly lali article; should any restless creature express a desire
for active work, he is scoffed at and scorned as a spoil-sport and
kill-joy.</p>

<p>During the Permantong Padi, the large wooden mortars,
wherein the rice is husked, are enclosed in bamboo railings, to
prevent human beings, and dogs also, from touching them. The
store of rice will last but a short time should these mortars be
touched by any hands other than those whose duty it is to use
them. If a dog in search of food, or of a place to sleep, crawl
into one of them, he is straightway caught, and his hair rubbed
the wrong way with a cord, which they call a ‘Tali Gamai.’
During this rubbing, the owner of the mortar exorcises the evil
Spirit by saying: ‘I stroke this dog thus, because I do not wish
my food to disappear on account of this dog. Let my food last
until the next year’s crop. One! Two! Three! Four!’ The
dog is sure to die, so they say, very soon after this ceremony.
These large mortars are fastened to the floor, and when not in
use are often used as seats, except during the Permantong Padi,
when even the deep hollow in the centre is plugged up, to keep
the dogs, which no railing can exclude, from licking it in their
search for remnants of rice.</p>

<p>Besides the Permantong Padi, there are many minor permantongs
in the daily life of the Kayans; for instance, in a Kayan
house it is permantong to whistle after dark. To play the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
kaluri, or the nose-flute, is allowable, even though thereby the
same sound as whistling is produced; whistling summons evil
Spirits, and is sure to bring mischief into the house. Some
Ibans aver that in old times it was strictly against all rule ever
to whistle in the house, even in the daytime.</p>

<p>It is permantong, or lali, for a member of a dead man’s household
to give anything to be used in laying out the corpse; cloth
or other things necessary for such purposes may be obtained from
any other than a member of the same house. When in need of
such things, the relatives and friends should ask for them when
the patient is moribund, and not after death has put a seal on his
lips, preventing him from making the request himself. When the
corpse has been laid out for several days, no one, whether a
member of the household or not, is willing to sell or give any
thing to be placed upon the corpse; it may be placed, however,
close by the corpse with perfect propriety, together with cigarettes,
which carry messages to dead friends. Dr. Hose told me that
on one occasion, while he was talking to Tama Bulan, in his long-house
on the Pata River, a message was brought to the Chief
from a very sick man, with the request for enough white cloth to
make a ‘Bah’ or waist-cloth, wherein to die. Tama Bulan asked
whether the message came from the man himself or from his
relatives, and showed no inclination to give the cloth until he
learned that the man was still alive; then he very willingly produced
the number of fathoms desired. He explained afterward,
that had the man been dead, and the request come from the
relatives, he would not have given the Bah. Had he given it
under these circumstances, it would have angered the Spirits,
and they would have claimed the giver as the next victim.</p>

<p>When a man is sick and likely to die, no one in the house is
allowed to open boxes, or any receptacles whatever, at night,
except it be the small tobacco boxes of bamboo which all carry,
or the ordinary baskets wherein they keep the sleeping-mats;
breach of this law brings death into the room in which the offence
was committed.</p>

<p>It is lali to cook inside the house the flesh of deer, buffalo,
wild cattle, tiger-cats, many of the smaller mammals, and the
large lizard (<i>Veranus</i>,—sometimes as much as six feet long,) and
only old and proved warriors may eat the flesh of deer; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
timid disposition of the animal enters the souls of youths who
are rash enough to eat of it.</p>

<p>Very similar to the search for omens in reference to the rice-fields
is the observation of omens preliminary to the search for
camphor crystals, (which are found in a tree known to botanists
as the <i>Dryobalanops Camphora</i>.) Before setting out for the
depths of the jungle where the camphor trees grow, the Kayans
first look for a bird known to them as ‘Isit’—a Spider hunter,
(<i>Arachnothera longirostris</i> or <i>Anthreptes malaccencis</i>,) and should
it be seen flying across their path, from right to left, the omen
is not good, there will be poor luck in their search; if it be seen
flying in the opposite way, there will be good luck. After they
have seen the Spider hunter, they must next look for the common
Red Hawk, whose flight must be also from left to right; if
its flight be from right to left, their search will be fruitless, or else
some heavy calamity will happen to them, and they had far better
return home at once. When both these Omen bearers have
been seen flying favourably, the Pajan, or Rain Bird, and the
Tela-au, or Barking Deer, must be either seen or heard on the
right-hand side of the trail; but even when all these omens have
been favourably observed, the camphor searchers are not yet free
to pursue their quest. For a final omen, they seek for a certain
snake, ‘Batang limu,’ (<i>Simotes octolineatus</i>,) and the most strenuous
efforts must be made to kill it; should it escape, they may
as well return home; they will find no camphor, even though all
the other omens have been auspicious.</p>

<p>As soon as they have decided upon the tributary stream, near
whose banks they are to direct their search, a rattan is stretched
across its mouth, as Jamma explained to me, and as is set forth
on page 115 above; on this rattan are hung wooden images and
models of parangs, billiongs, spears, and the wooden wedges used
in splitting up the trunks of the felled camphor trees; this gives
notice to other camphor hunters, or to passing strangers, that the
stream is closed and all trespassing forbidden. When they have
selected the camphor tree, which they intend to cut down, they
build their hut near it, and then, after the first strokes of the
axe, if they hear the note of an Omen bird, they give up work
for the rest of the day, and sit idle in their hut. But if all omens
are favourable, and they find that the tree is likely to prove rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
in camphor, they plant near their hut a stake, whereof the outer
surface has been cut into curled shavings and tufts down the
sides and at the top. (I suggest as possible that these shavings
represent the curling tongues of flame which communicate with
the unseen Powers.) When the Kayans are collecting camphor,
they are under no restrictions as to food, nor are they forbidden
to speak to people whom they may meet, although they will not
allow strangers to enter their hut. With many other tribes, all
communication with strangers is strictly forbidden; the Sibops,
for instance, when asked, by people whom they meet, the usual
question:—‘Where are you going?’ maintain a stony silence.</p>

<p>When the camphor tree has been felled, the trunk is cut into
small pieces, and during this process the searchers are clad in
their most showy war-clothes and armed with parang and spear.
It is in the crevices of the fibre of the wood that the crystals are
found, (a peculiarity of the Borneo camphor,) and the searchers
seem to regard the tree as a fallen foe, who can be made to
yield his hidden treasure only at the point of sword and spear.</p>

<p>The search for the crystals is tedious work; each piece of
wood must be split with the greatest care and examined with
minuteness. No camphor is found beyond twenty feet from the
root, and trees productive of camphor crystals are always hollow;
it is, therefore, probable that no crystals are found unless
the tree has been in some way injured. Besides the crystals,
there is always an abundance of oil, useful as an embrocation;
and there is also usually a quantity of soft camphor, called
‘Kapor Bata,’ not yet crystallised; yellow, resinous crystals are
of no value. The blossoms of the tree have a strong smell of
camphor, and near its roots is usually found a peculiar luminous
fungus.</p>

<p>Many tribes when on an expedition for camphor must not talk
among themselves in their own language about their quest, but
must use ‘camphor language.’ The Malanau tribes are herein
very strict; the crystals will immediately dissolve if any language
be used other than the camphor language. The Malanau word
for <i>to return</i> is ‘muli,’ but when in the presence of a camphor
tree they say ‘beteku;’ <i>to hide</i> in the Malanau language, is
‘palim,’ but when on a camphor hunt they say ‘krian.’ Similarly,
all common names for implements and for food are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
changed. One would expect to find an interesting remnant of
an ancient language in this camphor dialect, but it is very doubtful
if there be any such remnant there. This curious custom
prevails throughout Borneo, and in the Malay Peninsula also;
possibly, it was introduced by the Malays to preclude all outside
interference in the trading transactions between the natives and
themselves.</p>

</figure>

<p>Among some tribes, when engaged in camphor collecting,
the names of Chiefs and of influential men must never be mentioned;
should any one violate this rule, the trees are always
found camphorless.</p>

<p>Wives dare not touch a comb while their husbands are away
collecting this valuable gum; the fibres of the tree will duly
reveal abundant spaces where camphor ought to be found; but
if a comb has been touched at home, these spaces will prove
empty and resemble the spaces between the teeth of a comb.</p>

<p>Husbands are able to discover, by certain knots in the tree,
when their wives are unfaithful; and in former days, many
women are said to have been killed by jealous husbands on
evidence no better than these knots.</p>

<p>The leathery sheath of the leaf-stalk of the Penang palm
is used as a plate for food, and it must not be washed during
the whole time of an expedition for camphor, for fear that the
camphor will dissolve and disappear from the crevices of the
tree.</p>

<p>No one is allowed to bathe except at daylight and at nightfall;
no song is sung; no deer of any species should be eaten at
these times; the collectors are, however, allowed to hunt for
smaller game with the blow-pipe.</p>

<p>(The finest camphor is that which is found in large, transparent
crystals, about three-quarters of an inch long; this often brings
in the up-country bazaars as much as forty or fifty dollars a
pound. The chief camphor workers are the Punans, who are
either hired as guides and helpers by the Kayans, Kenyahs,
Sibops, or Ibans, or else they collect the camphor themselves
and barter it with the other natives, who in turn sell it to the
Chinese.)</p>

<p>With almost every tribe the name for camphor-hunting is
‘Paji.’</p>

</div>

<p>When we parted company with the somewhat unpeaceful
Peace-party at Tama Aping Buling’s, as previously narrated, we
set out by ourselves to visit a settlement of Punans, which had
been for some months past in the jungle a short distance from
the head-waters of the Dapoi. The sense of freedom and relief
from the responsibility of that host of warlike peace-makers
could not fail to add to our enjoyment of this lovely river; but,
even apart from this private, personal emotion, nothing can be
imagined more thoroughly and charmingly tropical than the
scenery, shifting and changing at every stroke of the paddle, on
which we now entered. The sky was cloudless, the temperature
delightful; great trees, slanting far over the river, interlocked
their branches overhead, and, in perfect sun-flecked shade, we
pursued our slow way over the curling, bubbling, and babbling
water, with our men lazily poling or paddling the canoes. Little
blue, green, and red king-fishers darted across our bows, hither
and thither, from the tangled undergrowth on the banks; from
huge, distorted branches covered with delicate little bright-green
ferns, dangled long, sweeping vines, which had caught in their
coils clumps of stag’s-horn fern and gay orchids, thus adorning
our pathway with hanging-baskets of Nature’s own handicraft;
large, startled fruit-pigeons glided swiftly under the archway of
boughs, stirring the leaves with the wind from their swift wings;
and from the depths of the ever-dripping jungle resounded the
hoarse croak of the horn-bill or there was wafted the plaintive,
melodious call of the Wawa monkey. Except for these sounds
and the gurgling of the water, all nature was absolutely hushed,
and the odor of damp, rich earth and warm leaves was heavy,
like the atmosphere in an orchid-house in winter.</p>

<p>The banks of the Dapoi are somewhat thickly populated,
and we halted at several houses, where we made ourselves most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
welcome by largesses to the women of strips of bright yellow
or of gay red cloth, for frontlets, and to the men we gave handfuls
of Java tobacco. From the female heart, as grateful as, in
this instance, it was vain, our gifts received an immediate appreciation;
when we took our departure, the river-bank looked like
nothing so much as a bed of marigolds and poppies in fullest
bloom.</p>

<p>At dusk we arrived at Tama Balan Deng’s,—a village of
Sibops recently moved over from the Rejang. The Chief gave
up his own room to us, and, hospitable soul, without hinting it
to us, quietly and silently moved his family into an adjoining
temporary hut; for his house was only partially completed.
We found here that tobacco was smoked by the men much more
frequently in pipes—a rare custom in this part of Borneo—than
in cigarettes. These home-made pipes differ so widely from any I
have ever seen or heard of, that possibly they are worth a word
of description:—The stem is a piece of bamboo more than an
inch in diameter, into which is set a straight, slim bowl, which can
hold only a small wad of tobacco. In the stem they insert a
plug of shredded palm leaves, or of shavings of wood, bound on
a stick; and then take the end of the stem into their mouths,
and having first got the tobacco well alight by a few gentle puffs,
they give a powerful suck, whereby the wad of glowing tobacco
is drawn down through the bowl into the stem, but is prevented
from reaching the mouth by the plug of palm leaves. Their
name for a tobacco-pipe is ‘S’puk,’ which seems to be an imitation
of the sound of the check given by the plug of palm leaves
to the wad of tobacco under the vigorous suck.</p>

<p>Very few of the inmates of the house had ever before seen
white people; and we had a crowd of gaping spectators constantly
about us. During our first night, almost all the inmates
crowded into our room, as I said above, where they remained,
positively the whole night through, watching us, exchanging
observations on our personal appearance, and lost in wonder at
our clothes, our marvellous paleness, the colour of our eyes
and of our hair. We opened our eyes at daylight, in time to
catch sight of the women in the group creeping out, almost on
all fours. This creeping, crouching, feminine mode of walking
obtains among almost all the tribes; when women pass a group<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
of men on the veranda, they must crouch down as low as they
can; or even when they have themselves been of the group and
wish to leave it, they must creep away, not rising higher than a
squatting position until they are at a distance. Thus it was, on
this present morning; when they withdrew from this inquisitive
vigil they crouched until they were outside the room.</p>

<p>Tama Balan’s was the last house on the Dapoi, and as we
continued up the pleasant stream we seemed to have left all
Borneo behind us. Suddenly we caught sight of a young
Punan girl standing in a canoe near the shore, and so earnestly
engrossed in stamping grated tapioca root through a piece of matting
to strain it, that she never noticed our approach. When at
last she looked up and caught sight of our canoes, and the inconceivable
white beings in them, in a flash she snatched up her
mat and basket of tapioca, and darted into the jungle, like a
startled fawn. She was such a pretty picture, as she stood in her
canoe, absorbed in her work, that I told one of our men to find
her and lure her back with promises of rich presents, if she
would allow me to take a picture of her. She was quickly
found, and brought back somewhat reluctantly; never before
had she seen white folk, and what idea the making of a picture
conveyed to her poor, little, bewildered brain, cannot be fathomed.
In reminiscence, it must have seemed to her a hideous dream; she
was told to go on with her work, while a horrible monster, with
a face as pale as ashes, and incomprehensibly clad, stood off at a
distance, and placed on three long sticks an awful object, that
expanded and contracted, hid his face in a black cloth, looked
at her with an awful eye for a moment, gave her a big piece of
yellow cloth and a handful of tobacco, and then with his black
object and long sticks was off again in a canoe;—such, at
least, was her utterly bewildered and dazed expression, as she
stood motionless in her canoe, holding in her hands the yellow
cloth and the tobacco, her only proofs that she was not dreaming,
and glancing from them to us alternately as we disappeared
rapidly round the turn of the river, vanishing into empty space
from which we had as suddenly and mysteriously emerged. No
Punan mind could doubt that she had been visited in a trance
by supernatural Spirits.</p>

<p>Not long after this, the river grew so shallow that we deserted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
the boats, and walked for miles and miles, so it seemed, up the
bed of the stream.</p>

<p>At last, as we were nearing our destination, we halted for rest
and refreshment, at a rice-field hut; and here there strolled
in upon us one of the Punans themselves from the settlement;
he had been out with his blow-pipe after small game. He made
no attempt to conceal his speechless wonderment at white people,
and silently gazed at us in open-eyed and open-mouthed astonishment.
When our Sibop guide, whom we had brought from
Tama Aping’s, as an interpreter, asked him whether he had ever
before seen white men, he replied, with awestruck earnestness,
‘Never anything like them have I seen! Surely they must be
the Fathers of all People!’ Ever after he referred to us or addressed
us as his ‘fathers.’</p>

<p>Not long after resuming our march, our guide suddenly turned
off from the river-bed into the open jungle,—that is, jungle in
which there is but little undergrowth, except thorny palms and
rattans. It is the ideal forest primeval, where old and majestic
trees form in every direction vast, illimitable, solemn vistas. On
a sudden, our guide asked us to halt and keep perfectly silent,
while he went on ahead to give notice to the Punans that some
peaceful, friendly visitors were approaching. Unless this notice
were given, he declared that the people would scatter at the first
sound of our approach, and we should find nothing but empty
huts. When he returned, he guided us down a slight hill and
over a stream, and through a dense hedge of tall plants of wild
tapioca. We emerged into more open ground, and were all at
once in the Punan village. The huts could be hardly distinguished
from the surrounding grasses and palms, so low and
fragile were they. The walls were merely boughs and twigs
interlaced, and against them leaned broad palm leaves; the roofs
were a loose thatch of leaves and boughs, but could not be more
waterproof than the natural roof of leaves overhead. The ‘village’
comprised only four huts, and in not one of them could
I stand upright.</p>

<p>Outside the huts, when we approached, there seemed to be
only a few old women. Although our friendly intentions had
been announced, the younger folks had hidden in the huts, so
as to observe us from a safe distance through the chinks in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
leafy walls. There were only two men in the village when we
arrived; all the others were away hunting with blow-pipes, or
after camphor, gutta-percha, rattans, or other products of the
jungle, which from time to time they trade off with their more
civilized neighbors, the Sibops and Berawans, for cloth, tobacco,
salt, etc. Three old women, however, at once greeted us, and,
coming up boldly, insisted on touching all of us, passing their
hands over our arms and our backs, and talking volubly all the
while in a plaintive and much injured tone of voice. It was
quite depressing. I was sure that we had unconsciously wounded
their tenderest and holiest feelings, and that they were reproaching
us for wandering near their ‘sacred bower’ and molesting
their ‘ancient solitary reign;’ but, before long, I was immensely
relieved by finding that a tone of petulant but resigned remonstrance
was the common and invariable intonation of each and
all. Little by little all fear was dismissed, and we were soon
surrounded by a merry, but sad-voiced, crowd of boys and girls,
young women and old; even babies in arms,—I should say,
babies in slings on their mothers’ backs,—were pressed forward,
not merely to look at us and to touch us, but to be touched by
us. Gentle, simple-hearted creatures, they believed that merely
to stroke us or to be stroked by us, brought them blessings;
this then, we found, was the meaning of the feeble stroking and
caressing touches that greeted us from the old women. Our
interpreter told me, that what I had imagined were reproaches,
was a continuous plaintive murmur of how good and kind it was
of the wonderful white people to come so far just to see them
and bring them blessings. They examined and admired everything
we had with us or on us; our coats, our hats, our shoes,
the buttons and button-holes on our clothes,—these excited their
profound wonder.</p>

<p>A book of photographs, which I had taken during a former
visit to the Baram, was looked at over and over again; they
never wearied of it, and their clucks of admiration were constant
while they explained to one another the meaning of the pictures.
After they fully understood that these miraculous pictures had
been made by my camera, they became absolutely without fear
of having their pictures taken,—indeed, in their simple hearts,
they had somehow come to believe that thereby bodily ailments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
would be cured. In the photograph of a group of women and
children, on the opposite page, in the corner on the right, there
sits a poor, unhappy mother, whose unfortunate little baby is so
hopelessly and enormously hydrocephalic that it could never
leave the basket which she holds in her lap. She begged me for
medicine to cure it, but when I told her that there is none that
would do it any good, she piteously begged to be allowed to sit
in the front line, so that the little patient might derive the full
benefit of the picture-making. Just beyond her stands another
devoted mother, who, in order to bring the powerful curative
effect of the camera to bear on the alleviation of the severe sufferings
of her little boy, is holding her hand on the abdominal
locality, where little children most frequently have pains. On
her right, and again in the front row, are women afflicted with
goitre, which they, too, hoped would be cured by the picture-making.</p>

ONLY HEALTHY-LOOKING PEOPLE, THEY BELIEVED THAT THEREFORE PICTURE-MAKING
MUST BE A PANACEA FOR ALL AILMENTS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Punans are nomads, never building permanent houses,
nor remaining long in one locality. Of all the tribes they are,
perhaps, the most mild and gentle; they are not head-hunters,
and care no more for a collection of human heads than for that
of any other animal, and, therefore, never go on a raid. They
know the country more thoroughly than any other natives, and
are always sought by the Sibops, Kayans, Kenyahs, and Ibans as
guides in expeditions after camphor, gutta-percha, and bees-wax.
They live solely on the products of the jungle, esculent roots and
plants, such as caladium, wild tapioca, a species of canna, the
tender, uncurled fronds of ferns, and the heart of several species
of palm.</p>

<p>The men are extremely skilful with the blow-pipe and in the
construction of snares and traps. When they are not surfeited
with small birds, they are completely happy with roast or boiled
monkey, and as for the small Bornean porcupine,—it is a delicacy
never to be rejected. For some reason, which I could never discover,
they will not kill a python. Salt, tobacco, and rice are
downright luxuries. They cultivate no fields, owing to their
nomadic life; consequently, the Punan fathers and husbands and
sons work hard to obtain from the jungle, far and near, those
articles for which they themselves have no use, such as camphor,
bees-wax, etc., which they can barter with Malay and Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
traders. Most valuable of all these articles is rhinoceros horn;
in fact, the killing of a single rhinoceros places the wealth of a
Punan village almost ‘beyond the dreams of avarice;’ there is
no scrap or portion of the animal that is not prized; the flesh is
coveted food; the horn, nails, hair, skin, and even the contents
of the stomach, are traded at the highest rate of exchange to the
Chinese, who use them all for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>It falls to the lot of the women to prepare the tapioca root
for food, an operation which takes the place of the monotonous
pounding and threshing of rice in other tribes.</p>

<p>These roots, which look much like sweet potatoes, are first
scraped or grated on a piece of the stalk of a rough, scaly palm,
and the coarse pulp is then washed and strained by stamping it
through a mat while water is constantly poured over it; this
washed and strained pulp is then collected in wooden troughs and
allowed to settle. The sediment is a thick, white paste, which
when boiled makes a very palatable farinaceous diet. The paste
may be also dried and preserved for future use. The roots of
the <i>Caladium esculentum</i> are either boiled like potatoes or mashed
and made into a sort of gruel. We partook of all the toothsome
dishes of the Punans except boiled fern-fronds and monkey;
neither happened to be in the Punan larder at the time. I must
candidly admit that to me the sight of the preparation of tapioca
is not appetizing. In the first place, the hands which hold the
tubers while they are being scraped are none too icy clean, they
often dabble in the pulp just after they have been successfully
busy in alleviating a neglected or troublesome coiffure. In the
next place, the finely scraped pulp is taken to a stream and
deposited in a mat which rests in a trough, or in a large wooden
bowl, on a little platform over the stream. The operator then
jumps into the mash and executes therein a lively dance, while,
from time to time, a small boy dips up water from the stream and
splashes it over the legs of the dancer, to wash down the particles
that may have been spattered up, and also to moisten the
mash. Strange to say, the paste, when strained, is of the most
pure and dazzling whiteness.</p>

<p>To be sure, this operation is no worse than wine-making;
but then we very seldom see the must foaming round ‘the white
feet of laughing girls;’ whereas we cannot pass a day, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
tapioca is the standing diet, without seeing our dinner mashed
by girlish feet by no means white,—or clean.</p>

<p>Our men built for us a temporary hut, which, in comparison
with any of the Punan huts, was a palace; unfortunately, it had
one serious defect; its location seemed to be over an extremely
popular thoroughfare of stinging ants,—those veritable little
devils. Just as we were about to turn in for the night, a broad
procession of thousands of them, every single one with its vicious
little tail turned defiantly up, began a diabolical march across our
floor of bark. The natives, however, immediately built a small
fire directly in their path, which at once caused, first, a stampede
of the vanguard, and then all the rest turned tail, and, still in
quadruple or sextuple file, retreated somewhat more rapidly than
they had advanced, and, at last, all disappeared under the leaves
on the ground outside. Next to land-leeches, they are the most
pestiferous and noxious insects in the jungle. They do not wait
to be attacked, but are instantly aggressive when a victim comes
within their ken; and they know to a nicety where the skin is
most sensitive. Their bite is quite as severe as the sting of a
wasp or of a hornet.</p>

<p>The Punans are pure jungle-folk, and know very little
about canoeing or swimming. When we asked to be taken to
some place where we could bathe, we were led about a mile
away to a delightful, deep, sandy-bottomed pool; but our guide
thither could not be persuaded to enter the water, and warned us
repeatedly to be careful, as the water was very deep,—it was
hardly up to our waists. When we ducked under, a native
bystander shouted in genuine terror that one of the ‘white
fathers’ was drowned.</p>

<p>To test their skill in marksmanship with the blow-pipe, we
fastened a potato about an inch and a half in diameter on a pole,
and from a distance of fifty paces they stuck in it six darts out
of ten. For small birds, they seldom use darts, which cost some
trouble to make; little pellets of clay are equally effective;
poisoned darts are reserved for monkeys and larger game.
They assert that with a properly prepared dart they can kill
even the formidable rhinoceros. For such large game, the point
is weighted with a little triangular head of bamboo or of tin,
which carries more poison, and becomes detached in the wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>When we bade farewell, we gladdened every Punan heart by
distributing all that remained of our gay cloth and good tobacco;
the cloth was quite sufficient for every woman and child in the
village to meet the tolerant demands of fashion in the way of
apparel; and as for the tobacco,—I longed to know what prodigious
stories they would rehearse, as they sat round their fires
in the evening, of the marvellous appearance and mysterious
actions of the ‘White Fathers.’ But my heart was woeful for
that little mother as, day by day, she would discover that the
‘picture-making’ had brought no healing balm to her poor,
hydrocephalic boy.</p>

<p>There is one product of the Punan country which I think
deserves a note: it is that luxury so dear to the Chinese palate,
the edible nests built by swallows, or swifts, in certain limestone
caves. In the Niah hills, near the coast, these caves have been
the breeding-places of these birds from time immemorial, and in
supplying the market with their nests the Punans have been for
many a year employed by Chinese traders, and the estimate is
well within bounds that several hundred tons of nests have been
there gathered by this tribe.</p>

<p>Within the caves of Mt. Subis,—one of the Niah hills,—there
is a small settlement of Punans who, during the building season,
collect nests. There are three harvests of nests, then the season
closes, and the swallows are allowed to rebuild undisturbed and
rear their brood.</p>

<p>When I visited the village of Niah and the caves in Mt. Subis,
the season was closed, but it had been so very successful and had
kept all the natives so busy that those, whose duty it was to
attend to the rice crop, had neglected it; consequently, the
people of Niah,—a mixed tribe of Malanaus and Punans,—were
actually suffering from a rice famine; boats had been sent to
neighbouring villages to purchase rice, but they had been away
for thirty days or more, and almost every pound in the village
had been consumed, except a goodly store in the secure granaries
of a stingy, avaricious old head-man, Orang Kaya Perkassa
by name, who demanded such an unconscionably exorbitant price
for it that even to starving men it was almost prohibitory.</p>

SMALL CHILDREN.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And thereby hangs a tale. A strange old fellow was this
Orang Kaya Perkassa, tottering on the brink of the grave, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
possibly for this very reason, saturated with superstition. I
took the opportunity, when he happened to pay me a visit,
to beg him graciously to grant me the privilege of taking his
picture. He refused point-blank and with unusual vehemence;
but at last he so far relented that he professed his willingness to
submit to the hazardous operation, if he might be allowed to
return to his house and procure such charms as would safeguard
his person and counteract the baleful effects of the picture-making.
Of course, I readily acquiesced, and in a few minutes
he reappeared with a ponderous bundle of infallible charms, (they
may be seen in his photograph, girdling his waist,) which were
oddly shaped pebbles, malformed boars’ tusks, strange knots of
wood, etc., (I was not permitted to see them, but from my knowledge
of Bornean charms, I cannot be far astray.) As soon as the
exposure was over, in an imperative tone he demanded a picture
of myself, saying, ‘Since the Tuan now has my picture, it is in
his power to do all manner of harm to me, unless I have one of
him to keep me safe.’ Before I had time to tell him that I really
had no picture of myself with me, several of the natives who had
accompanied me on the trip besought me most urgently to refuse
his request, insisting that should this wicked old man once get
hold of my likeness he would work most powerful charms with
it, and I should inevitably die within the month.</p>

<p>It appeared that Orang Kaya Perkassa had recently suffered,
under his own roof, an extraordinary piece of ill-luck; a Malay
had there run amuck, and, after slashing several of the inmates
very severely with his parang, had fled to a hut on the river-bank,
where he had been surrounded and finally speared to death.
This, of course, involved no end of bad luck to the Orang
Kaya’s house; wherefore to exorcise the evil Spirits a great feast
had been held, poles elaborately decorated with carved faces were
erected to frighten away demons; and, finally, the blood of
slaughtered pigs and chickens, together with pieces of their flesh,
was sprinkled over both cooked and uncooked rice, which, combined
with salt and native ginger, was enclosed in small packages,
and solemnly placed in a miniature boat and set adrift on the
river, to the end that it might bear out to sea all the ill-luck of
the household, and waft it where it could do no one any harm.</p>

<p>After I had finished photographing the Orang Kaya in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
own quarters, I left him busy talking to some of his friends,
and, with my camera, strolled casually toward his house. After
having taken a picture of the ‘demon frighteners’ erected near
his dwelling, my attention was attracted to a collection, on his
veranda, of uncouth, worm-eaten, water-worn, wooden idols,
openly displayed on a shelf and draped with extremely dirty
bits of coloured cloth. I had just finished photographing them,
when the Orang Kaya himself suddenly hobbled up the notched
log, and was at my elbow. He was exceedingly angry, I am
sorry to say, at my boldness in taking a picture of them during
his absence, and I did my very best to soothe him, and apologized
humbly for my intrusion by urging my ignorance. I succeeded
at last in appeasing him, and had just calmed him into a fairly
peaceable frame of mind, when, unwittingly and most unluckily, I
undid all that I had done, by innocently offering to buy one of
the worm-eaten figures. Never shall I forget the violent, vehement,
towering rage into which he fell, nor the flood of Malay
which my proposal called forth. ‘How dare Tuan ask such a
thing?’ he almost shrieked, his wrinkled and cross-wrinkled
features working with rage. ‘Shall I sell for money my gods of
good fortune! Those are gods, <i>gods</i>, I tell you! they are not
wood! they are my honored guests, my dearest friends! from
the broad sea they came to me! and they will bring me blessings
if their livers are not enraged by having a picture made of them.
Never would I have suffered it had I been here; the people in
the house should have stopped it! Surely, surely more misfortunes
will now fall on me!’</p>

<p>He then stamped into his room and slammed the door. The
evil my camera had done must be thwarted. Accordingly, from
that sunset till dawn, and even into broad daylight, every gong,
big and little, in the Orang Kaya’s house was kept hot with beating.
All through the weary vigils of that night we heard this
incessant din. ‘The good that’s done we may compute, but not
the ill prevented;’ therefore, who can say what success attended
this fervent zeal? That it was not successful, the Orang Kaya
himself probably believed. For certain it is that he sickened
and died within three or four weeks. His death was really due, I
believe, to old age, hastened by an unbridled temper and a life
of avarice, so strong that, as I have mentioned, he was willing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
his neighbors and even his own household should die of starvation
if only he could add to his wealth.</p>

<p>His people, I learned afterward, attributed his death to my
camera, but I rather imagine that by this time they have found
out that my camera really brought them an unmixed blessing in
disguise.</p>

<p>Mt. Subis is only about fifteen hundred feet high, and the
entrance to the birds’-nest cave on the mountain side is some
little distance from the base, and can be gained only by a very
tortuous and narrow path round the ledges and projections of
slippery limestone.</p>

<p>Not far from the main cave is a smaller one, known as the
‘Traders’ cave,’ wherein is a village of twenty or thirty huts,
for the accommodation of the Chinese traders who come to pay
for the nests that have been collected. It is a village of houses
without roofs; within the cave there is no fear of the sun smiting
by day nor the moon by night, nor of rain from clouds;
consequently, the houses are merely walls and floors, and
pretty wobbly walls and floors in addition. The roof of the
cave, frescoed with green mould and lichen, is fifty or sixty feet
overhead, with irregular projections of limestone, but free from
stalactites. No swallows build here, the cave is too light and
shallow.</p>

<p>The Punans’ cave, beyond, is of majestic size; just within the
entrance the floor dips abruptly to a deep valley, and the roof
curves upward in a vast dome; hence, from the level of the valley
to the roof is at least six hundred feet. Insensate, indeed,
must he be who is not filled with speechless awe as he turns
from the brilliant sunshine and enters this illimitable abode of
silence and of night. It seemed the veritable entrance to the
Inferno; and as the light from the opening struck the massive
projections here and there, and cast long, blacker shadows, it
became a landscape in the moon, while the appalling, death-like
stillness seemed to presage a frightful cataclysm in nature.
Underfoot is a deep carpet,—fully three feet deep,—of what
seemed tan-bark, but which proved to be a fine, dry, odorless
guano, composed mostly of the wing-covers of insects, of a dark-brown
color; the jagged sides and roof, and here and there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
boulders projecting through the covering of the floor, were covered
with a deep-green mould or lichen, except where the white
limestone gleamed out in patches and seemed almost phosphorescent.
The extent beyond, in the utter darkness, seemed illimitable.</p>

<p>Our presence and the echoing of our voices soon startled the
swallows, and forth they emerged, in myriads on myriads, from
the darkness, and circled round us and above us, and about the
mouth of the cave like swarming bees; the whirr of their wings
and their twittering sounded like waves on a pebbly beach.</p>

<p>On a flat ledge at one side, near the entrance, was a line of
fifteen or twenty of the platform dwellings of the Punans, even
more fragile and tumble-down than the huts in the ‘Traders’
cave.’ At the time of our visit, the huts were deserted, giving
an air of even greater desolation.</p>

<p>The nests are obtained by lashing long, stout poles, end to
end, and then supporting them with guy-ropes of rattan until
they reach to the very top of the cave. Up these poles the agile
Punans climb hand over hand and foot over foot, walking up
them like monkeys; when at the top, they scrape down the
nests within reach, by means of a long pole bearing a hoe-like
blade, and with a home-made wax candle fastened to it to show
where the nests are. An assistant below gathers the nests as
they fall. There are two varieties of nest, the black and the
white; the latter sell for two thousand Mexican dollars a picul,
(one hundred and twenty-three pounds,) the black nests bring
only a hundred dollars for the same weight. Unfortunately, the
Niah caves are ‘black nest’ caves; but the nests are so very
abundant that the export revenue tax assessed on them by
the Sarawak Government amounts to thousands of dollars in
a year.</p>

<p>The Punans, however, are not the owners of the poles in the
caves, but, on account of their skill in climbing, are hired by a
Malay or Chinaman, who pays so much a season to the Government
for all the nests gathered in an area prescribed by the length
of the detaching-pole. The Punans do not use the nests as food,
and have learned their value and the best times and methods of
harvesting them only since Chinese and Malay traders have come
to Niah. The caves, however, have been inhabited by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
Punans for very many years. We found tobacco growing wild
not far from the mouth, and we were told that it is to be found
in considerable quantities all about this locality. The Punans
know it well and gather it, but maintain that it is none of their
planting, and that it has been known to them and used by them
as long as they can remember.</p>

<p>As to the relationship of the Punans to the other tribes of the
interior, Aban Deng, of the clan of Long Wats, (who in turn are
closely allied to the Kayans, Kenyahs, and Sibops,) gave us the
following account:—‘An old Chief living far in the interior highlands
of Borneo, left, at his death, two sons, one of whom was
energetic and laboured in the rice-clearings, while the other was
incorrigibly lazy. With such different temperaments, the affairs
of their common household soon became much disordered, and
they agreed to separate, each one choosing the families that were
to follow them, and thereafter all were to live as they pleased.
The lazy brother and his adherents, who preferred hunting and
roaming, betook themselves to the jungle, never built houses
nor cultivated rice; their descendants are the Punans of to-day.
The industrious brother, named Plian, and his adherents cleared
the hills of jungle, planted rice, and built strong houses; from
them are descended the Sibops and Long Wats. The Punans,
after many years of wandering, determined to begin the cultivation
of rice; two of their Chiefs collected them in a fertile valley
near the base of “Bukit Bulan,” or the Mountain of the Moon,
that high mountain in the centre of Kalamantan, (Borneo,) and
they all set to work clearing off the jungle, while the Chiefs
stood in a group and gave directions on all sides. The Punans,
utterly unversed, however, in the cultivation of land, set fire in
many places at once to the jungle when it was felled, and their
leaders, thus surrounded by a circle of fire, perished in the
flames. Dispirited and discouraged at the loss of their leaders,
they once more scattered, and have ever since wandered in
small bands throughout the jungle, depending on their blow-pipe,
and snares, and the fruits of the forest, for their sustenance.’</p>

<p>When a Punan of the common class dies, his body is stretched
out simply in a little hut of boughs and leaves, with no further
burial. The corpse of a head-man or of one of his family is, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
the other hand, wrapped in a coarse mat or a sheet of bark-cloth,
and, doubled up in a squatting position, is forced into one
of the baskets they use for carrying loads on their backs. It is
then placed on a platform of poles, and over it a flimsy shelter
of leaves.</p>

<p>Were the choice of a residence in a Bornean tribe forced on
me, I should not hesitate long in casting my lot with the Punans.
They have never a thought of the morrow; no cares; no responsibilities;
no possessions; no enemies, for they desire nothing
that other people have, not even clothes; money is dross;
and home is where they rest their blow-pipes and hang up their
parangs. Night can never find them homeless; home is wherever
the setting sun finds them; does rain threaten, a few poles
and a few leaves make a house; let the night be clear, and a
soft bed of leaves in a nook between the great flat roots of a
Tapang tree is luxury itself; for ‘where youth with unstuffed
brain [never was a Punan brain ‘stuffed’] doth couch his
limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.’</p>

<p>And, finally, in the happy land of the Punan there is no
dressing and undressing morning and evening.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TUBA-FISHING"><i>TUBA-FISHING</i></h2>

</div>

<p>There are two varieties of Tuba<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> known to the natives, and
used by them to poison fish in streams; these two varieties are
called by them ‘Tuba Berábut,’—a shrub, and ‘Tuba Ja Jaran,’—a
creeper; Tuba Berábut is more generally used, and is known
to Botany as <i>Derris elliptica</i>. The poison is extracted from the
bark of the creeper, and from the tubers and roots of the shrub.
It seems to kill the fish by suffocation, and does not injure them
for food; and as they do not die at once, but rise to the surface
of the water, and dart hither and thither to evade the poison,
there is not a little sport in spearing them or scooping them up
in nets; at any rate, a Tuba-fishing is made a great occasion by
all the tribes, and furnishes almost as fruitful a topic of conversation
as a war expedition. To none of the tribes is the sport
more attractive than to the Kenyahs, who live in the mountainous
districts of the interior of the island.</p>

<p>The streams usually selected for this form of fishing, are the
tributaries of the larger rivers,—mountain streams as clear and
cool as crystal, flowing over pebbly beds. High over-arching
trees, draped and festooned with ferns, orchids, and vines, ward
off the heat of the sun and tone down its glare to that emerald,
translucent green of damp, dense tropical forests. The swish and
tinkle of the water as it rushes over the rapids above and below
the deep pools which the fish frequent, and the musical calls of
the Wawa monkeys, alone break the stillness, until the arrival
of the merry, happy party of fishers from a Kenyah long-house.
The women are bedecked in their finery of gay head-gear and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
bright bead-work necklaces. The young, unmarried damsels
prove to be the life of the party, and are endlessly chaffing their
lovers; the sidelong glances from beneath palm-leaf hats are as
arch and coquettish as any ever cast from behind a spangled fan.
Fun and innocent frolic rule supreme as the canoes race and
jostle with each other round sharp turns where the stream runs
swift, or over the turbulent rapids. The women catch the excitement
of the fierce, desperate paddling; they stand up to the
work, their jet-black hair streams over their shoulders, their
tawny bodies sway with the boat as they dash from their paddles
the ‘tender, curving lines of creamy spray.’ The men shout in
triumph or laugh in defeat; and even the old crones cackle and
urge on the youths to the sport. The scene is idyllic; there is
nothing to revolt, everything to charm. Careless, untamed life
amid a tropical jungle is to be seen at its very fairest on one of
these Tuba-fishings among the Kenyahs.</p>

<p>The best time for the sport is during the dry season, when
the rivers are low and the stones, left bare on the wide banks of
the river, supply material for the dams, where the fish may be
‘rounded up.’ A dam is built of loose stones, either straight
across the river, or else in a wedge-shape with the point up-stream,
thus forcing the fish close to the bank on each side,
where the chase is to end. When it has been built about eighteen
inches high, a platform of rattans, with little fences at the
sides, is placed in the centre of the dam or wherever the fish will
be apt to congregate. The up-river end of this platform rests on
the bottom of the stream, and the down-river end is about on a
level with the surface of the water. In their mad endeavour to
escape the suffocating poison, the fish make futile attempts to
leap the dam, but by the force of the stream and their own
exertions they land on the platform, where an active watcher
deals death to them with a stick.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus86.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>SCENE ON A LEVEL STRETCH OF RIVER IN THE CENTRAL-HIGHLANDS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The day before the expedition, all who wish to have a share
in the fish must contribute a due proportion of Tuba root, which
is gathered in the jungle and scorched over a fire to make it
more virulent. After the Tuba has been gathered and the day
appointed for the fishing, then so much as even to breathe the
name of Tuba is forbidden; if reference must be made to it,
then it is to be called ‘pakat Abong;’ Abong is a strong-smelling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
root something like Tuba, and pakat means <i>to agree upon</i>;
thus, ‘pakat Abong’ means <i>what we have agreed to call Abong</i>.
This concealment of the truth deceives all the bats, birds, and
insects, which are always keen to report to the fish all the sayings
and doings of men, and, as Tuba has not been mentioned, no
warning can be given. On one occasion, after a Tuba-fishing
had been planned for the morrow, one of our party noticed a
man with a bundle of roots, which he recognised as Tuba, and,
following the usual Bornean custom of asking a question when
at loss for a subject of conversation, inquired what was in
the bundle. The reply was ‘pakat Abong.’ ‘Indeed,’ said the
questioner, ‘I thought it looked like Tuba.’ At this mention of
the fatal word, woe-begone looks passed round and every countenance
fell, whereupon the Chief explained: ‘We Kenyahs call
that root Abong when we wish to use its white juice, and those
animals which live in the water [avoiding the word <i>fish</i>] we call
“Daun” [<i>leaves</i>] which float down stream; did we not do so,
when we want to stupefy them with this juice, those good-for-nothing,
prying beetles called “Balli sunggong,” or some other
friends of the <i>leaves</i> such as the bats, or some kind of bird,
would instantly carry the news of our intentions, and then where
would be the use of all of our preparations? The <i>leaves</i> would
quickly disperse, and we should have to return from our pleasant
excursion empty-handed and hungry. They might even invoke
their powerful charm-working <i>leaf</i>,—the bony Balira,—to call
down heavy rains and make the streams rushing torrents, and
then good-bye to all our sport. But calling things by their
wrong names, we fool these <i>leaves that float down stream</i>, and
have a good day’s sport out of them.’</p>

<p>The ‘Balira,’ a fish full of bones and worthless as food, is supposed
to be the Dayong of the fish. The legend runs that the
fishes, aware that there was none among them who would devote
himself to working charms, determined to elect a Dayong. No
fish could be found to accept the office until, finally, the Balira
offered his services on condition that every fish should give him
one of his bones. They all agreed, with the result that now the
Balira is choke full of bones, and a very skilful worker of charms
to counteract the plans of mankind.</p>

<p>The boats assemble about a quarter of a mile above where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
the dam has been built in the river. On the bank, logs are placed,
whereon the Tuba roots are pounded to a pulp, which is then
swashed round and squeezed out in some of the smaller canoes,
which have been half filled with water. The men pound, keeping
time with their blows; and again and again the pulp is
washed in the canoes until every drop of the sticky, white juice
has been extracted. Then whitish clay or lime is mixed with the
poison, to make it sink and spread through the water. Sometimes
as much as two or three hundred weight of roots are
pounded up for one fishing, the amount, of course, depending on
the size of the stream. But before any poison is cast in, a certain
quantity must be set aside for the Spirits. One of the party,
therefore, goes a little further up the stream to some insignificant
pool which has been left on the pebbly bank, (wherein—alas!
for poor human nature,—any one could see with half an eye that
there was no fish,) and, pouring in the Tuba juice, he calls out:—‘O
Spirits of the Rocks! of the Wood! of the Smooth, Flat
Stones! of the Karangans! of the Earth! and of the Leaves!
here in this pool is your share of the numberless fish! Spoil not
our sport by any interference!’</p>

<p>After this generous sacrifice has been made to the superior
Powers, all the boats assemble round the canoes containing the
poison, which are then suddenly tipped over, and the milk-white
paste sinks to the bottom and contaminates all the water. One
man in a small canoe goes in advance of all the rest, and the first
fish that rises to the surface is caught in a scoop-net and thrown
out on the bank; at the same instant the man again shouts to
the Spirits that this fish is for them, and that they ought not
grudge the small share that will probably fall to the lot of the
party. This pious duty having been performed, the fun at once
grows fast and furious. With shouts and splashes and jeers and
laughter, all the canoes plunge into the chase after the fish which
rise to the surface. As every where under the cope of heaven,
here, too, the funny man is on hand, and laughs uproariously at
his own fun after he has excitedly given false directions as to
where the largest fish are coming up, and mocking those who
miss their game; boats get entangled, but an occasional upset
creates no ill feeling; the occupants are soon back in their places,
and engrossed with spearing and scooping up the fish. The very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
old and the very young are stationed on the bank to catch the
small fish or to drive the larger ones from their hiding-places
under the overhanging roots and branches.</p>

</figure>

<p>So the whole party slowly drift down-stream, heaping their
boats with the stupefied game until they reach the dam, where
the man stationed on the rattan platform, or ‘Bering,’ has had a
busy time of it, too; not only has he had to see to it that no
fish escape, but he has also to keep a very keen look-out for
his own safety; many of the fish have sharp, poisonous spines,
which, if he be not careful, make ugly and excruciatingly painful
wounds in his feet.</p>

<p>When all the fish possible have been caught, the party disembark,
and fires are lit beneath green-wood platforms whereon
the fish are spread after having been split and salted for future
use. The plumpest and largest are always cooked and eaten on
the spot by the keen-set fishermen, who revel, even to gorging,
in the dainty change from their monotonous daily fare of
boiled rice and dried salted fish.</p>

<p>With canoes, and hampers, and bodies filled, as the low
descending sun sends shafts of amber light down the long reaches
of the river, the fishers again embark, and lazily dip their paddles
in the glowing water as the current drifts them on their homeward
way. The red-letter day is over, but the joy of it remains
for ever in the laughing gossip round the evening hearth.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> I asked to have these words repeated to me after the ceremony; they are as
follows: ‘Nilang megang beleuer, tebuku urip lakip makun alun!’ This ‘tebuku’
(knotted cord) illustrates a custom among the Kayans and Kenyahs which, I think,
is noteworthy. When they wish to make a record of days or of things, they do so
by tying knots either in a thin strip of rattan or in a cord of bark-fibre; this strip is
called a ‘tebuku.’ It was a source to me of never-failing wonder to note how
accurately and for what a length of time the maker of the strip can remember what
every knot represents. I have seen a ‘tebuku tali’ (‘tali’ here means <i>strip</i>) wherein
there were possibly three hundred knots, recording every article seized in a raid
on a long-house; every knot or group of knots represented an article or collection of
articles, and the itemized list was read off months and months afterward by the man
who tied the knots, and, for aught I know, he could have remembered them for years.
Of course, none could read it but the man who made it.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> The words ‘laram,’ <i>cool</i>, and ‘manin,’ <i>hot</i>, are used idiomatically; if a man is
told to do anything, he need not instantly obey, as long as the command is, as he says,
still ‘manin;’ if a man lay down a tool for which another has been waiting, the
tool must not be instantly picked up, it is still ‘manin.’ A heavy, or, perhaps, an
unjust fine, is termed ‘manin.’ The sense in which the old Dayong here used the
word ‘laram’ is, I think, quiet and firm, like Tama Bulan, not hot-headed and
inconstant.</p>
